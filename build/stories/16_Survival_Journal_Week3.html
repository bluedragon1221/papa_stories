    <h1>Survival Journal - Week 3</h1>
    <p><em>This week was no picnic because it is called Survival Week.
    It is one week of actually eating only what we could find on the
    trail. In the desert of southern Utah, there isn’t much to eat, so
    it was nearly about 5 days of fasting.</em></p>
    <h2 id="sunday-august-5">Sunday, August 5</h2>
    <p>Sundays in the wild are always special. Priesthood was at nine
    and Sacrament meeting right after. I spent most of the afternoon
    reading. That night at 7:30 we had a fireside. Our family sang a
    song with a couple of made-up verses to the tune of “Where Oh Where
    Are You Tonight”. Chuck and Sharon are a married couple,
    accompanying our group as instructors. See the made-up verses
    below.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Old Chuck was a desert rat, grubby and smelly.<br />
    For some crazy reason the desert he’d roam.<br />
    He crawled through the sand on his chin and his belly.<br />
    The canyons and badlands, he called them his home.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Chorus:<br />
    Where, oh where are you tonight?<br />
    Why did you leave me here all alone?<br />
    I searched the world over and thought I found true love.<br />
    You found another and phphttt!! you was gone.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Now Sharon, his sweetheart, was orn’ry and lanky.<br />
    Just like a tough snake she was wiry and lean.<br />
    She’d blow her big nose on her sleeve or her hanky.<br />
    She was tougher than any guy you’ve ever seen.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Chorus:<br />
    Where, oh where are you tonight?<br />
    Why did you leave me here all alone?<br />
    I searched the world over and thought I found true love.<br />
    You found another and phphttt!! you was gone.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="monday-august-6">Monday, August 6</h2>
    <p>Monday was the prelude to Survival Week where we live off of the
    land for the whole week. We left our camp near Bull Mountain at noon
    and hiked about 7 miles into the Henry Mountains. It was a steady
    climb all the way and our campsite was at well over 9000 ft. All
    along the way Sharon showed us what was edible and what was not. We
    found such things as pinion nuts, wild onion, elder berries,
    currents, raspberries, dandelions and yaro. Some of it tasted good,
    but most of it tasted bitter or tasteless. That night was the
    coldest one I have had to endure out here yet.</p>
    <h2 id="tuesday-august-7">Tuesday, August 7</h2>
    <p>Tuesday morning, we ate the last of the food that we had in our
    food packs. It consisted of unsweetened oatmeal, boiled grain and
    fried jerky. We hiked about three miles that day to Crescent Creek
    for our next campsite. The leaders give us trap making and map
    reading lessons along the way. We also gathered all the food we
    could find for dinner and breakfast the next morning. We ended up
    with hordes of wild onion and only a few handfuls of currents and
    service berries. I also spent several hours roasting pinion
    pinecones over a fire to extract the seeds from them. My effort
    yielded about 2 pop cans full of green tasteless pinion seeds.</p>
    <p>That afternoon a Sister Nina Robinson was driven out from her
    home in Hanksville to speak to us. She was an expert naturalist and
    told us much about what plants we could eat. That night we had a
    short fireside, and I ended the day by calling a family prayer.</p>
    <h2 id="wednesday-august-8">Wednesday, August 8</h2>
    <p>Wednesday, we rose early for a sunrise service with all of our
    staff leaders. They each took their turn to talk to us about temple
    marriage and the family unit. It was a very spiritual meeting and I
    enjoyed it immensely. After the meeting the entire staff left us,
    not to rejoin us until we reached base camp on Saturday. We now had
    to function on our own as a united group. Before they left, the
    staff told us that very few groups came in after survival week
    united and together. They felt we had the strength to do it and felt
    the weight of the challenge. Before breaking camp, we cooked our
    morning meal of wild onion soup, service berry tea and pennyroyal
    tea. The onion soup, which we had had the night before also was not
    very nourishing. The broth was good, but the onions were like
    chewing on old hey. I liked the berry broth quite well, but the
    pennyroyal was nasty.</p>
    <p>We hiked about three miles that day to our next campsite,
    gathering pinion cones, onions, dandelions, and a few more berries.
    Already the lack of nourishing food was beginning to zap my
    strength. I found myself drawing within not eager to socialize but
    only wanting to suffer alone. I was not pleased with my performance
    as part of the group that day. When we got to camp, we all sat
    around the fire and roasted pinion cones while someone read talks
    from the April Conference. It did much to bring us together and
    function efficiently as a group. That night after dinner of nuts,
    berries, and tea, we had a short fireside and retired to bed early.
    Before going to sleep I prayed that the Lord would lift my spirits
    and give me the strength to endure this trial.</p>
    <h2 id="thursday-august-9">Thursday, August 9</h2>
    <p>Thursday morning, I felt nauseated and weak, but the spirits of
    the group were high and helped to cheer me up. My suffering was not
    as great as some of the others, for I helped to give a blessing to
    one of the girls who had been a family mother with me in the
    previous week. Breakfast was a handful of green pinion nuts and a
    little berry tea. We hiked seven miles that day to Box Springs. We
    are still in the Henry Mountains and the scenery was beautiful. Our
    attitudes were good, and it was a great experience to feel the love
    of the group that day as we hiked. All were helping one another and
    cheering each other up. The going was slow and laborious. I would
    pant as if I were running, from a slow walk up a slight uphill
    grade. Once I sat down it was a terrific effort to get up again. We
    collected quite a bit of food that day compared to the others. We
    had pinion cones, currents and elder berries. After arriving at the
    Springs we again listened to conference talks as we roasted pinion
    cones. We were then given an hour of time to ourselves at which time
    I am now caught up with my journal. The flies are driving me crazy,
    but I am too tired to brush them off. Actually, I can still count my
    blessings. Most of my feet troubles are gone and with luck we may
    reach camp tomorrow night. I sure do miss my parents, family and the
    comforts home though.</p>
    <h2 id="friday-august-10">Friday, August 10</h2>
    <p>Last night we had another short fireside in which we read the
    account of the birth of Christ and acted it out. I was a wise
    man.</p>
    <p>The Revenge has finally hit me. I have to run into the bushes
    frequently now. All I had for breakfast was some elder berries and
    hot water. We broke camp early today because our goal is to reach
    base camp before dark. Our destination is Cass Peak Reservoir which
    is 16 miles away. This distance seems an impossibility to me in my
    present state of being. Our group is still united though and
    together with the Lord’s help, I know we can make it. We started
    hiking at 8:15 and I felt sick and weak most of the morning. At
    about the halfway point we found a little creek where we stopped to
    rest for an hour and eat some currents and elder berries we had
    found. It ended up being nearly two hours before we left again. We
    trudged on through the heat of the day and I concentrated on putting
    one foot in front of the other. Finally, we crossed Stanton pass and
    as we descended into the valley, we spied the reservoir in the
    distance. I think I know how the pioneers must have felt when they
    had their first glimpse of the Salt Lake Valley. I nearly came to
    tears of happiness. There were shouts of joy and many burst into
    singing. We still had three miles to go, but our spirits were high,
    and our tired bodies strengthened from the sight. As we rounded the
    last bend, united and together, we sang “Shall the Youth of Zion
    Falter”. We had done it and we were grateful. Immediately, we knelt
    in prayer to offer our thanks. It was 7 o’clock when we arrived. It
    had taken us about 9 hours of hiking to cover those 16 miles.</p>
    <p>My first action was to unroll my bedroll and collapse into sleep.
    I had to get up and head for the bushes 3 times during the night to
    avoid disaster. When I awoke the next morning on Saturday, I felt
    incredibly weak. I dosed until 11:30 when we held a short service on
    fasting and its purpose. I now know or have a deeper understanding
    of what true humility is. I have never felt so humbled before in my
    life. The rest of the day and tomorrow until fast and testimony
    meeting will be spent in prayer and scripture reading. Saturday
    afternoon seemed very long. Most of us were just waiting it out
    until the staff came with food. I read parts of the D &amp; C and
    Jonathon Livingston Seagull. My case of Revenge has dried up, mainly
    because it has emptied me completely out. I have never had such a
    hollow feeling before. Saturday night was long too. It’s like
    waiting all night for Christmas morning. I often indulged in dreams
    of all the good foods I’ve ever eaten.</p>
