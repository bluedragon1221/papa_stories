    <p><em>This article will serve as the outline of my life. It
    describes the locations I lived in throughout my life and a few
    memories from each place. Thus, it will serve as an index to the

    <h2 id="lakeview-oregon">Lakeview, Oregon</h2>
    <p>I was born in Lakeview, Oregon on July 16, 1953. My father farmed
    with his brother, Frane, and father in the surrounding farmland, but
    the family home was located in the town. I was born 6 weeks
    premature and weighed less than 5 pounds. I spent some time in an
    incubator before the doctors let me come home. I remember a photo,
    long since lost, of me lying on a bed next to a ruler that was
    larger than I was. It was a rather humble beginning to a grand life
    full of love and adventure.</p>
    <p>The first home I lived in was very small and located near the
    railroad tracks. I have no memory of this house or what it looked
    like. The family moved to another small home with blue shutters
    where I remember a few very hazy experiences. On one occasion I was
    playing with some neighborhood children. One of them told me to
    close my eyes and open my mouth. That “friend” then threw a handful
    of dirt into my mouth. They all laughed and ran away. I calmly
    walked home and showed my mom that I had dirt in my mouth and needed
    help to clean it out. I was too young to realize that someone had
    played a mean-spirited trick on me. I just thought it was a game I
    didn’t really understand.</p>
    <p>The last house I lived in, in Lakeview, was a three-bedroom home
    on the main road into town. I lived there until I was 6 years old.
    We lived next to a kind old lady we called Grandma Green. We spent
    hours over in her back yard climbing in her apple tree. I remember
    learning how to throw rocks at grasshoppers and catching them in her
    large, graveled driveway between our two houses. Whenever we were
    able to catch a grasshopper, we would carry it over to the
    dining-room window where our pet spider had a huge web in the window
    well. We would throw the bug in her web and watch her descend from
    her hideout in the corner and wrap the bug in a silken blanket. She
    grew very fat that summer from all the tasty bugs we caught for her.
    When school started, I walked to and from school without a care in
    the world about being abducted by the boogeyman. I did this for both
    kindergarten and 1<sup>st</sup> grade. It seemed to my little legs
    like quite a long walk, but was probably only about 5 or 6
    blocks.</p>
    <p>Our simple life in Lakeview came to an end abruptly one night
    while the family was at a drive-in movie. We were watching “The
    Greatest Show on Earth” when a message came over the speaker that
    was hanging on our car window. The message was something like this,
    “Would Ralph Williams please come to the ticket booth. You have an
    urgent phone call.” When he came back, he told us the grain elevator
    was on fire and we had to leave right away. Dad and his brother
    owned and operated this building which processed wheat and barley
    into pellets of feed for cattle. When we arrived at the scene from
    the drive-in movie, the entire upper floor of the building was
    engulfed in flames. It was all kind of exciting and a bit
    frightening for a six-year-old, but I had no idea this meant a whole
    new life for me and the family. Nine months later, my dad got a job
    and we moved to Hermiston, Oregon.</p>
    <p>The following two stories occurred while I lived in Lakeview:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><a href="02_The_Knot_Hole_in_the_Old_Wooden_Bridge.html">The
    Knothole in the Old Wooden Bridge</a></li>
    <li><a href="03_Adventures_on_Black_Cap_Mountain.html">Adventures on
    Black Cap Mountain</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="hermiston-oregon">Hermiston, Oregon</h2>
    <p>Our first house in Hermiston was a tiny house, but we only lived
    there for a few months. Behind the house was an open field where we
    played. It had one feature that was better than any playground we
    had ever seen. It had a huge old stump with all the roots still
    attached to it. It had been pulled out of the ground by some monster
    eons ago and left there for our personal entertainment. We could
    climb all over it and pretend anything our little imaginations could
    come up with. It was a castle, a bean stalk, an airplane or
    Rapunzel’s tower. It was way better than Disneyland.</p>
    <p>The next house we lived in was right across the street from the
    school. It had a huge weeping willow in the back yard that was
    perfect for climbing. Behind the house was a huge vacant lot that
    was swampy in parts and had a lot of big boulders and dirt hills
    near the back end. We often brought glass bottles out there and set
    them up on the rocks as targets for throwing rocks at. After a
    while, all the broken glass made the place treacherous, but we
    didn’t know any better and neither did our parents.</p>
    <p>I learned to ride a bike on the school yard, where we also often
    played during the summer. One time, while playing near the school, I
    bragged that I could throw a rock over the school roof. My friend
    said, “No way, Jose!” Of course, I couldn’t leave it at that and
    picked up the nearest rock and let it fly. To my horror, the rock
    didn’t make it to the roof, but instead went through a large window
    and left a gaping hole in the glass. My friend wasn’t horrified at
    all. In fact, he wanted to do me one better. He picked up a larger
    rock and through it through a larger window. Then we ran away as
    fast as we could go. I never told my parents or anyone else about
    our crime. I was pretty sure if anyone ever found out, I would go
    straight to prison. I don’t think I was eight years old yet, so in
    the Judgement Day, I’m hoping I can get a pass on that one.</p>
    <h2 id="oregon-city-oregon">Oregon City, Oregon</h2>
    <p>Soon after, my dad got a job with the Federal Land Bank and we
    moved to Oregon City. The house was a big old farmhouse out in the
    country. I expect we rented it from some old folks that didn’t want
    to farm any more. There were dozens of climbing trees, a huge old
    barn and an ancient prune dryer building whose roof had caved in. It
    was the perfect place for mischief and adventure. I believe I was in
    the 5<sup>th</sup> grade and went to school at Carus, a small
    unincorporated town 7 miles south of Oregon City. There were three
    grades in the same room, only 5 students in my grade and only one
    teacher for all of us. I was the only boy in my grade, but I wasn’t
    very interested in girls yet. After Christmas break that year, the
    school moved into a brand-new school built behind the old one.</p>
    <p>My brother and I built the coolest fort on the ground floor of
    the old prune dryer building. It was built out of stacked up red
    bricks that were just part of the rotting jumble there, but it was
    our own private place where we made candles out of wax and string so
    we could have a little light to see by. I suppose it as a miracle we
    didn’t burn the place down.</p>
    <p>The following stories happened at this location. The story called
    Trees covered a period of many years, but started during this
    time.</p>

    </ol>
    <h2 id="vancouver-washington">Vancouver, Washington</h2>
    <p>Dad was promoted to manager and was transferred to a new office
    in Vancouver. This meant another move. The new house was a flat
    roofed little affair just off Saint John’s Road on the northern edge
    of Vancouver. It was adjacent to a railroad, so of course, we had to
    leave a few pennies on the rails to get flattened by the trains. We
    spent a lot of time playing with the neighbors. Emily Edwards lived
    on the West side of us. She was my first crush. She never knew it
    because I wouldn’t have dared telling her. However, she probably
    contributed to the fact that my first daughter was named Emily.</p>
    <p>In the woods nearby there was a small lake where my brother and I
    liked to go fishing. We caught mostly Blue Gill, but often caught
    catfish big enough to bring home for mom to cook for us. We were
    only in this house for a year, but it made an impression.</p>
    <p>The following story happened in this house. However, it is listed
    as part of the group of pyrotechnic misadventures below.</p>

    </ol>
    <h2 id="ridgefield-washington">Ridgefield, Washington</h2>
    <p>My father bought 60 acres from an old guy named Aquinas Fox for
    $20,000. I remember when dad first brought us to the property where
    we would build our home. We drove the car out on the knoll to the
    home site. We were all amazed at the beautiful view of the North
    fork of the Lewis River valley. We could see 3 snow-capped peaks on
    the horizon and forested hills for as far as the eye could see. The
    house cost about $16,500 to build. We moved into the house in about
    1964 and became residents of the town of Ridgefield, although the
    house wasn’t actually within the town boundaries.</p>
    <p>I lived in this house until 1972 when I left to go to college at
    Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. It was here that I learned
    how to drive, bought my first car and several motorcycles, learned
    how to kiss a girl, and spent many lazy summer days in the river
    bottoms swimming and exploring.</p>

    Utah – First year at BYU, Fall 1972 to Spring 1973</h2>
    <p>I lived in the towers at BYU. This was a group of about 4
    thirty-story towers of student dorms near the campus. I lived on
    about the 20th floor with a guy from Oklahoma who spoke with a
    strong southern drawl. Dad rented a small trailer to haul my Honda
    650 and Tom’s Honda 350 to school for us, along with our stuff and a
    whole lot more for my “friend” Terri from Salem.</p>
    <p>While living in the towers, I got this wild-haired idea to grow a
    world’s record icicle during the winter months when the temperature
    often stayed below freezing for weeks at a time. I opened my window
    just a crack and extended my pool que about 18 inches out into the
    freezing air. I then rigged up a large soda fountain cup with a hole
    in the bottom just inside the window. A few straws channeled the
    water from the cup out the window onto the pool cue, where a short
    piece of rope was attached. When I filled the cup with water, it
    dripped slowly through the straws onto the rope suspended by the
    pool cue. I did this many times every day until the icicle grew
    about 20 feet long. After a while, the icicle got so big and heavy
    that I feared it would bend my pool cue, so I ended the experiment
    before the guy from the Guinness Book of World Records could come
    and measure it. So much for my dreams of being world famous.</p>

    <p>I spent 4 months at the Language Training Mission and 20 months
    in southern Brazil. It was a building experience for me because the
    Catholic church was so strong in those days that it was a real
    challenge to find people seeking the complete truth. See the article

    <h2 id="provo-utah-1976-to-1978.-roman-gardens-student-apartments">Provo,
    Utah – 1976 to 1978. Roman Gardens student apartments</h2>
    <p>We sarcastically called the complex the Roman Ruins because they
    were not in the best repair, but I had no complaints. I only slept
    there and spent most of my time on campus studying electrical
    engineering. I had a roommate named Rod and Jeff Rankin, who was the
    Elder’s Quorum president in our student branch. Both played a role
    in my marriage to the woman of my dreams, Lori Diane Fooks.</p>
    <p>I met Lori on January 22, 1978. She answered the door when I
    knocked on it. I was seeking one of her roommates to get information
    to request her membership records. I was serving as the branch
    membership clerk in the student branch. Since it was Lori’s
    birthday, she was having a party of sorts and was in a somewhat
    “feisty” mood. See the article, “The Day We Met” for Lori’s own very
    colorful account of this momentous event in the cosmos. Being the
    socially awkward nerd I was at that time, I was caught by surprise
    and was a bit frightened by her forwardness. I declined her offer
    and walked away, but her disarming sense of humor gave me the
    courage to return a few days later. I asked if the offer of cake was
    still good. She said the cake was all gone, but I could have some
    Jell-O if I wanted it. We began seeing each other more and more
    often after that.</p>
    <p>By the time Spring was starting to emerge, we were considered a
    couple in the branch, but not yet engaged. BYU sponsored an event
    called Preference, where the girls were responsible to ask the boys
    to go with them. Lori conspired with my roommates to kidnap me by
    surprise from the apartment just prior to the event. Jeff, the
    Elder’s Quorum president, was supposed to arrange to have me present
    at the apartment at the appointed hour. Accordingly, Jeff left a
    note on my bed that morning to ask me to meet him for an interview
    in the evening at about 6:30 at the apartment. When I saw the note,
    Jeff was already gone to campus and I thought it was odd he would
    ask me to have an interview at that specific time when we were
    roommates, and he could talk to me just about any day without an
    appointment. Like a clueless dufus, I blew it off and stayed on
    campus late into the evening working on my studies. When it was
    evident I couldn’t be found, Lori took my roommate, Rod, in my
    place. The date was a candlelight dinner under the stars on Squaw
    Peak followed by a trip to the Salt Lake Planetarium. I never had
    any idea what I had missed until the next morning when Rod told me
    how badly I had destroyed Lori’s surprise extravaganza.</p>
    <p>I realized I needed to make it right, so I began to do some
    scheming of my own for a big date the next weekend. I convinced a
    friend in the student branch who had his pilot’s license to do a
    double date with me and Lori by renting a 4-seater Cessna airplane
    at the Provo airport. We had about an hour of flying over the
    snow-covered mountains of the Wasatch Range. It was fascinating, but
    a little bit scary. My friend wasn’t a highly skilled pilot and the
    landing was pretty rough. We bounced quite hard on the runway, but
    he managed to get us back to the airport in one piece and with our
    underwear still clean. After the flight, we went out for breakfast
    at a pancake house. I think I spent my whole month’s allowance for
    that date, but at least I restored the prospect that a whole
    generation of amazing people would yet be descended from Lori and
    me.</p>

    <p>Lori and I were engaged on June 8, 1978, the same day the church
    announced the revelation about “All Worthy Males” to the world. We
    were married on August 26, 1978. We lived in a building of
    apartments for married couples still attending BYU.</p>
    <p>I graduated from BYU with my electrical engineering degree and
    started my master’s program so Lori could finish her degree in
    speech therapy. We lived in a second floor, two-bedroom apartment
    and soon moved up to the third floor because they had swamp coolers
    up there. I also started doing part-time work for a small start-up
    company near campus. Shortly thereafter, I ceased working on my
    master’s degree and started working full-time for SOS Computers for
    a starting salary of $16,500. Then, in early 1979 we learned that we
    would be parents for the first time. Lori managed to finish her
    degree just a few weeks before we welcomed Emily into the

    Fork, Utah – 1980 to 1989, SOS, Eaton-Kenway, Signetics</h2>
    <p>I don’t know how, but we qualified to buy our first house in
    American Fork for $49, 000 and moved into it in the Spring when
    Emily was still only a few months old. Our house payment was about
    $400. While living there, we welcomed Ryan, Megan and Mallory into
    our family. We had a small fleet of 2 Volkswagen bugs, one old green
    one I rebuilt after my mission and an orange one given to us by
    Lori’s dad. I left SOS and started working for Eaton-Kenway and had
    to commute up to Salt Lake City. That got very old, and we rejoiced
    when I got hired by Signetics in Orem, Utah for $22.000. After a few
    years at Signetics, I was making $54,000. We had a plan to pay off
    the house in about 4 years and enjoy a life of luxury forever in
    American Fork. The Lord must have needed a bishop in Maine, because
    the recession hit, and I lost my job. The only career door left open
    was in the state of Maine. I felt like we had been banished to outer
    Mongolia, but Maine turned out to be a wonderful place to raise our
    little family.</p>

    <p>They put us right to work in the Windham Ward, a very dedicated
    group of faithful saints just north of Portland, ME. I was called to
    be the 2<sup>nd</sup> counselor in the bishopric after only living
    in the ward for about 3 months. I was then bumped up to first
    counselor, then the stake hi counsel and eventually served as the
    bishop for 6 ½ years. Those 13 years were some of the most rewarding
    of my life.</p>

    Landing, Washington – 2002 to 2006, Flipping houses with Dad,
    WSU</h2>
    <p>These were some of the darker days of my life. The 2002 recession
    killed my livelihood in Maine. We packed up our belongings into a
    24-foot rental truck and took a week to drive from the east coast to
    the west coast. The house in Fisher’s Landing was a tiny 1050 sq.
    ft., 3-bedroom house in a development where the houses were only a
    few feet apart. We bought the house sight unseen for $130,000
    because it was affordable for a guy without a job. Emily and Ryan
    were at BYU and Megan joined them shortly. It was just Mallory, Lori
    and I living there where I tried to figure out how to rebuild my
    life.</p>
    <p>Lori and I worked with my father for a few years flipping houses.
    Working with my father was a blessing because he passed away in
    2005. It gave me a chance to spend a lot of time with him before he
    left this world. However, it soon became obvious that doing all the
    renovation work was very hard on my aging body. I was quite happy to
    be able to use a NAFTA program to go back to school at WSU. I earned
    a second bachelor’s degree in software engineering and was given a
    full ride scholarship and teaching assistantship to work on my
    master’s degree, also in software. I was just finishing my program
    when my mother invited us to live at the family homestead in
    Ridgefield. We didn’t think twice about leaving Fisher’s Landing.
    The housing bubble was raging, and we sold that house for $219,000,
    a $90,000 profit after living there for only 4 years.</p>
    <h2 id="ridgefield-washington-2006-to-2018-hewlett-packard-powin-energy">Ridgefield,
    Washington – 2006 to 2018, Hewlett Packard, Powin Energy</h2>
    <p>Shortly after moving to the homestead house in Ridgefield I
    landed my dream job at Hewlett Packard in 2007 and started working
    there full-time. It seemed like all the pieces had fallen into place
    for Lori and I to live out the rest of our lives in relative peace
    and financial stability. We spent most of the profits of our last
    home sale to upgrade and renovate the Ridgefield home. Just as it
    seemed that all our troubles were over, the housing bubble popped
    and the economy dove into the “Great Recession”. As a new employee
    at HP, I had no seniority and lost that job in 2009.</p>
    <p>NAFTA again paid for me to take some classes while on
    unemployment. I earned the Oracle Java Programmer Certification in
    October 2009 and the Oracle Java Developer Certification in March of
    2010. I also taught “Introduction to Database Systems” as an adjunct
    Professor at WSU from January to May of 2010. I did a little work as
    an independent contractor for a company called Griswold Water
    Systems until early 2011 and finally landed a job with Powin Energy
    in September of 2011. During those two years since losing my job at
    HP, there was very little income, but it always seemed to be enough
    to cover the basics and keep us out of debt. I attribute that
    blessing to many years of faithfully paying my tithing. The job at
    Powin was interesting because they were a start-up in the field of
    grid-scale energy storage, but the commute to the south side of
    Portland was an hour each way and there was always the hint that the
    company would fail before breaking into the big leagues and
    achieving a little stability. They finally ran out of investment
    funding and let me go in October of 2018.</p>

    <h2 id="meridian-idaho-2018-to-present">Meridian, Idaho – 2018 to
    present</h2>
    <p>After moving to Meridian, Idaho to live with our daughter, Emily
    Clark, I worked part-time for Dan, her husband, as his warranty
    issue fixer from January 2019 until July 2019 when I qualified for
    full retirement benefits from Social Security. The plan was to build
    an in-law apartment on their lot and enjoy just being “Nana and
    Papa” to our grandchildren. Apparently, the rest of our mortality
    was not meant to be a breeze just yet because we spent over 2 years
    fighting with the Home-Owners Association to allow the project to
    proceed. While waiting to resolve those issues, COVID-19 struck and
    traumatized the entire world. However, with my 67. 8 years of
    perspective to draw upon, I am at peace with all these tribulations.
    Through everything that has come my way, the gospel of Jesus Christ
    has always given me the peace and assurance that I needed to get
    past them. I can’t wait to see what else is in store even in these
    times of so much turbulence in the world.</p>
