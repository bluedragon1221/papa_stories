        <h1>Survival Journal - Week 1</h1>
        <p><em>Week 1 consisted of two sessions of instruction and 3
        days of torture, called Impact. The instruction did not mention
        Impact, or it would have scared everyone out of starting the
        course. I guess the theory was that after Impact, the rest of
        the course would seem like a piece of cake.</em></p>
        <h2 id="tuesday-july-24---530-pm">Tuesday, July 24 - 5:30
        pm</h2>
        <p>Since this is my first entry, I have a little catching up to
        do. I feel kind of silly, writing to myself like this. The
        flight down from Portland was really great. Flying into Salt
        Lake City over the lake was quite spectacular.</p>
        <p>I am presently at Grandma and Grandpa’s and have been
        visiting with them most of the afternoon. I will be staying the
        night with them. Our first day of instruction lasted from 9 am
        to noon. I was greatly surprised to find that the girls
        outnumber the boys 2 to 1. Many are unexpectedly very good
        looking while just as many are the husky, big bruiser types. I
        was very impressed with our leaders. There are eight of them for
        our group of 31. Our patriarch, Chuck, is a returned missionary
        and a very special person.</p>
        <p>We spent most of the time being introduced to the course,
        going over equipment needs and learning people’s names. They
        spared few details in telling us what to expect from the course.
        I think it will be a very spiritual experience as well as a very
        severe test of endurance.</p>
        <h2 id="wednesday-july-25---10-pm">Wednesday, July 25 - 10
        pm</h2>
        <p>After saying good-byes to the grand folks, I went to another
        session from 9 to 12. We were taught how to make bedrolls, flint
        and steel fires and how to take care of our feet. Afterwards we
        had a goal setting meeting. The kids in my group are really
        great kids and the meeting was a special experience. Many of the
        kids set their goal to improve their communication with and
        relation to our Heavenly Father. This is my goal too, but my
        main goal is to learn to base friendship on the inner, good
        qualities of people instead of outward appearances or other
        unimportant characteristics. I also want to learn to love others
        to the point that I care more about them than I do myself.</p>
        <p>I spent the afternoon making char-cloth and taking care of
        last-minute preparations. I ate my dinner very slowly and took a
        long hot shower. We leave for the desert at 6:30 tomorrow
        morning, so I won’t be able to enjoy such luxuries again for a
        month.</p>
        <h2 id="thursday-july-26">Thursday, July 26</h2>
        <p>The bus finally let us out on the trail at a vast open
        expanse of desert (near Keg Knoll). We were told to tank up on
        water, so I drank 10 pop cans full. It hurt to walk, I felt so
        bloated, but that only lasted about 2 hours. Our last meal was
        lunch and we started hiking at 4 pm. After 3 hours we started
        descending into Horseshoe Canyon. We kept descending until we
        reached the bottom at about 11: 30pm, our goal being to find
        water. The river bottom was dry when we got there, so we bedded
        down while the leaders went in search of water.</p>
        <p>By this time most of the canteens were dry and we were all
        hungry. This first three days is called “Impact” and,
        apparently, they don’t intend to feed us or allow us any time to
        search for food.</p>
        <p>The leaders came back in half an hour and led us groping in
        the darkness to a little marshy place. We couldn’t see what we
        were drinking, but it was probably better that we couldn’t. The
        water tasted of swamp, but at least it was wet.</p>
        <p>We finally started to bed down at 12:30. The girls got their
        fire going right away. The boys finally gave up and borrowed
        some fire from the girls. I suspect one of the leaders started
        their fire. By the light of the fire, I could see that the spot
        we had chosen to sleep in was covered with prickly pear cactus.
        I kicked away enough to make a bare spot and I thought it would
        be okay. However, by departure time I had succeeded in
        impregnating every article of clothing I had with little, tiny
        stickers. I’ll be picking those out for days.</p>
        <p>We assembled to leave at about 4:30 a.m. They told us to tank
        up on swamp water because it would be our best water all day.
        Few people drank much of it and it later proved to be a major
        source of trouble.</p>
        <p>We followed the canyon out till it joined the Green River.
        This river was so muddy that you couldn’t see the bottom of a
        teaspoon through it. It wouldn’t strain or settle, so the only
        way to drink it was to close your eyes and gulp. Sometimes you
        had to chew a little too.</p>
        <p>It must have been at least 90 deg. by 10 am and some of the
        kids started getting sick. Our goal this day was to hike about
        14 miles to some good water, but the sick ones made the going
        awfully slow. My attitude was one of impatience almost to the
        point of anger toward these people who slowed us down so badly.
        I just wanted to get to that water, rinse the grit out of my
        teeth, guzzle a couple gallons and plop down in a heap under
        some tree.</p>
        <p>I should say something about the country we were moving
        through. Both the Horseshoe and the Green River Canyons were
        breathtaking to behold. People were exclaiming all the time when
        we first started out. By the start of our second day, the
        comments had dropped off a little and by noon nobody even cared
        anymore. While you were busy watching your step on the trail, it
        was easy to walk right beneath a huge monolith or balancing rock
        without even noticing it. I tried to keep looking around while
        we hiked, but truthfully, I didn’t care all that much anymore
        either.</p>
        <p>Finally, they let about 10 of the healthier ones hike on
        ahead without stopping all the time for the lame and sick. The
        good water was supposed to be at the mouth of the Horsethief
        Canyon, and we set off at a fairly fast pace. I put everything I
        had into it and thought I was near exhaustion when we finally
        arrived at about 7pm. The little pond turned out to be back-up
        water from the Green River. It had settled a little, but you
        still couldn’t see through it and it tasted terrible. I began to
        wonder why I had been stupid enough to go on this survival
        thing.</p>
        <p>When the others arrived and we had rested for an hour, the
        leaders informed us that we would be hiking on up the canyon
        till late in the night. We trudged on after a prayer for
        strength and watched the stars come out. I was carrying an extra
        bundle that belonged to one of the sick girls who was unable to
        carry it. When it got so dark that we could barely see, I traded
        shifts and helped the sick girl keep going.</p>
        <p>I grabbed her belt from behind and pulled her along while she
        leaned on me for balance. Thus, we went tripping and stumbling
        on into the night. Melody was a rather stout girl. She
        out-weighed me by 20 pounds.</p>
        <p>My previous attitude changed rather quickly when I saw how
        sick this girl was and how much courage she showed by still
        trying hard and giving her all. I realized how fortunate I was
        to not be so sick and how little effort I had to use compared to
        her. There were many similar situations in the rest of the group
        and our love for each other certainly grew that night.</p>
        <p>We finally came to a little pool of water below an ancient
        falls where we decided to bed down. We offered a sincere prayer
        of thanks for the good water and guidance we had received. I had
        no trouble falling asleep on the rocks at about one in the
        morning.</p>
        <p>At daylight, we tanked up and trudged on. We had to reach
        base camp about 8 miles away to set up for the weekend. This was
        at the end of Big Springs Canyon. No one had much strength left
        on this third day of Impact. It took the combined efforts of all
        to keep the group going at a very slow pace. Several times we
        had to pray to our source of strength to keep us going. We
        finally arrived at about 1:30 in the heat of the day.</p>
        <p>The water there was good, and we offered many thanks for our
        arrival. We are now waiting for the supply truck to come with
        some food. I have been catching up my journal but, at least the
        ordeal of Impact is over. It certainly proved our motto, “If it
        doesn’t kill you, it will make you stronger” to be true. I have
        learned much about myself and my limitations.</p>
        <h2 id="monday-july-30---6-pm">Monday, July 30 - 6 pm</h2>
        <p>I’m sitting here at Mule seep wondering what’s going on. I
        hope this <u>is</u> Mule Seep. Anyway, I’d better take up where
        I left off.</p>
        <h2 id="saturday-july-28">Saturday, July 28</h2>
        <p>The supply truck finally came late in the afternoon. They had
        had car trouble, I guess. First, they gave us 10 gallons of tang
        and a carrot apiece to get our systems going again. Then, we
        organized into cook groups or family groups with a men and
        women’s leader. Connie, a very nice RN, and I were chosen as
        leaders of our group. We would fill the role of mother and
        father of the family group for the week. Then the weekend food
        was distributed to each family group. We were given hamburger,
        potatoes, carrots, oatmeal, flour, brown sugar, salt, and milk.
        We had a fairly decent stew for our dinner that night. That same
        evening, we organized our student branch. Jay Bossardt is our
        Branch President.</p>
