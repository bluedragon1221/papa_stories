    <h1>Chocolate Waterfalls</h1>
    <p>Just after my 20th birthday, in the summer of 1973, I decided to
    take a course at BYU about desert survival. I spent about 30 days in
    the deserts of Southern Utah learning how to live like a desert rat.
    On one hot and sultry day, my group was walking through a dusty
    little canyon when the skies started to grow very dark and ominous
    looking. The wind started to pick up and began to blow sand and dust
    into our faces. Our leaders told us that a thunderstorm was coming
    our way and that it would be a good idea to try to find some
    shelter. We found a little overhang of rock that afforded us just
    enough room to stand underneath it as the thunderstorm arrived. It
    was a nice spot to watch the show that nature was about to perform
    for us.</p>
    <p>The sky continued to darken as the thunder cell approached. Then
    the rain began to fall. First, there were only a few big fat
    raindrops that smacked into the rocks and dust, making little
    plopping noises. Then, suddenly, the bottom dropped out of the
    clouds as they dumped their heavy load of water right on top of us.
    I was astonished to see our little canyon come alive with the motion
    of rushing water. It seemed like the canyon walls almost instantly
    erupted with a hundred waterfalls. These waterfalls were not the
    beautiful crystal clear waterfalls you see in the pictures on
    postcards. These were dark muddy brown waterfalls. They looked like
    gushing streams of chocolate milk falling from every crack and
    crevice in the canyon walls.</p>
    <p>The lightning was as good as any fireworks show I have ever seen.
    Huge branching forks of light stabbed the ground with a mighty
    cracking noise. The sudden crack was followed immediately by a
    bellowing boom that temporarily drowned out all the noise of rushing
    water.</p>
    <p>The gurgling little stream in the creek bed soon became a
    boiling, rushing soup of muddy water mixed with all sorts of desert
    debris. It was deep enough to soak our hiking boots, but we had no
    fear of being swept away by the current. Fortunately, our little
    overhang kept the rest of our clothing fairly dry as the thunder
    cell did its best to impress us with its prowess. Almost, but not
    quite as quickly as it arrived, the thunder cell moved on and the
    show was over. Within 20 minutes, the skies began to clear and the
    sun came out again. Everything returned to normal except for one
    thing. The water in the creek was still 6 to 8 inches deep and
    covered most of the creek bed in the floor of the canyon. As we
    picked up our gear and resumed our march, we had to slosh through
    the muddy water instead of walk on nice dry sand as before.</p>
    <p>As we marched on, it slowly began to dawn on me that the creek
    was our only source of drinking water in the desert. With some
    measure of alarm, I realized that my water canteen was nearly empty.
    I began to imagine the worst. I imagined that the muddy brown goop
    that we were presently walking in was probably contaminated by all
    sorts of disgusting toxic stuff like drowned jack rabbits, dead
    scorpions and coyote poo. I couldn’t bear the thought of drinking
    such a foul brew. I uttered a silent prayer in my heart. Please let
    me find some other source of drinking water before my canteen runs
    dry. That night I went to sleep with a fervent hope that a new day
    would bring a miracle. My canteen was now empty.</p>
    <p>I slept fitfully on a little shelf of rock under another overhang
    in the canyon. It was about 20 feet above the level of the canyon
    floor. When I awoke the next morning, I peered over the edge of the
    shelf to check out the water. My heart sank when I saw that the
    water still looked like dark chocolate milk.</p>
    <p>Expecting to die of some terrible disease, I slowly picked my way
    down to the water’s edge with my canteen. Maybe I could find a quiet
    little pool where the water wasn’t quite so nasty looking. To my
    utter amazement and delight, I found a tiny little spring of water
    bubbling up out of the ground just a few feet from the edge of the
    creek. As I filled my canteen, my heart filled with gratitude. The
    water was cool and clear and tasted refreshingly like the mineral
    water you can get in an expensive restaurant. To this day, I have
    never looked at a glass of water quite the same and I certainly will
    never again take such a simple blessing for granted.</p>
