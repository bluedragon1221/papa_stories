    <h1>Survival Journal - Week 5</h1>
    <p>Non-journal comment: This week started with 3 days called Solo.
    It was supposed to be the highlight of the course where each
    participant internalized the life lessons of the previous weeks of
    challenge and hardship. However, I spent most of my time resting,
    cooking, and eating. It took another 30 years of living to fully
    internalize all those life lessons. I guess I’m a slow learner.</p>
    <p>Early Sunday morning two big-forked bucks walked below unaware of
    my observance. To my horror, I found that the water in the stream
    was still muddy red. I spent about an hour gathering firewood and
    cooked some oatmeal with the water I had in my canteen. I then went
    upstream in search of a spring I had passed the night before. To my
    delight I found one much closer to my &quot;home” which issued a small
    stream of cool clear water.</p>
    <p>I spent most of the rest of the day doing just that—resting. I
    cooked up little goodies much of the time, read a little and dozed
    some too. I immensely enjoy this experience of quiet, leisure and
    meditation. I cannot think of much else that I could ask for to make
    me happier or more contented.</p>
    <p>Sunday night 9 pm - I’m sitting against my base camp bag, staring
    into my campfire and listening to the quiet drone of the crickets.
    I’ve just finished a fantastic meal of lentil, potato, and carrot
    stew with sugared ash cakes and a bedtime hot totty of warm milk and
    brown sugar. It all gives a man a great deal of peace and
    satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Monday morning, I spent cooking breakfast, gathering more wood,
    and going for water. Now that I have time to examine myself, I have
    discovered how truly grubby I am. I can rub grimy black stuff off of
    my face and arms. I have been wearing the same pair of pants for a
    month now. They have everything from sheep fat to ash cake dough on
    them. Oh well, in a few short days I will be able to take a hot
    soaker bath at Grandma and Grandpa&#39;s place.</p>
    <p>For lunch I cooked up an excellent gravy for my ash cakes. I
    derive immense pleasure from cooking over a campfire and eating my
    tasty concoctions. They have given us a rather large food pack for
    solo and I find that I am spending much of my time preoccupied with
    cooking and eating. I feel a little guilty that I have not used more
    of my time for the purpose it was intended; that of meditation,
    prayer and earnest thought. I should write most of my paper today, a
    task I don’t much look forward to. I guess I had better get
    started.</p>
    <p>Evening -- A gusty wind has begun to blow through the canyon. My
    house is not very well protected from wind and I’m getting lots of
    sand blown all over everything. Fortunately, as with most desert
    weather, it was a short-lived storm and lasted only about 45
    minutes. A quiet peace has again settled over the canyon. I cooked a
    delicious stew of rice, potatoes and TVP and retired for the night.
    I kept my fire burning all night and my overhang retains the heat
    well. I enjoyed the luxury of sleeping in my T-shirt all night.
    During the night, my house was visited, or I should say invaded, by
    a big-eared desert mouse. First, he attacked my moleskin hatband and
    when I took that out of his reach, he ransacked my toilet paper. He
    certainly was a daring little fellow.</p>
    <p>Breakfast Tuesday morning was cracked wheat mush and left-over
    stew. I whiled away the morning by gathering wood, getting water,
    and cooking a big batch of ash cakes. Then I read until about 2:30
    when I decided I had better try to finish my paper. As I began to
    write, the clouds began to move in, and it started to thunder. It
    was another diller of a thunder and lightning storm. This time I
    enjoyed watching it from the comforts of my home and was grateful
    that it is so well protected from the rain. It did not even stop me
    from starting to cook some lentils for tonight’s dinner, but it did
    distract me from my writing. This time also I was able to appreciate
    how spectacular the storm was. Large, gushing waterfalls seemed to
    spring instantly from the canyon walls. The little creek rose to a
    torrent in only a half hour. Those raindrops must have been as big
    as marbles and yet, here I sit as dry as a bone. It’s really neat to
    see a great flash of lightning and instantly hear and feel the great
    crash of thunder with its following rumble down the canyon. This
    storm lasted less than half an hour. Now, as I write, another one
    has just, passed over. I almost wish they would go away so I could
    get on with my writing of my paper.</p>
    <p>At about 6:30 I was surprised to see one of our instructors,
    Russ, walking up the creek bed. It was raining lightly, and he was
    soaked to the skin. He waved and I called out to invite him up to my
    humble abode and warm himself by my fire. I had been expecting him
    or someone all day because they had told us that an instructor would
    come to interview each of us on Tuesday. I had almost given up hope
    when the storms came and was very happy to see another human being
    after three days of solitude. After a prayer we shared our thoughts
    and feelings of the past month. As we talked, I felt his love and
    concern for me and was very grateful to have shared those few
    moments with such a dedicated instructor. We closed the interview
    with prayer, and he left, still wet, but perhaps a little warmer. I
    then reheated my lentil stew, ate a meager dinner and retired for my
    last night of solitude. The little field mouse came to visit again
    that night only this time I gave him some cracked wheat, to keep him
    busy.</p>
    <p>At 5:30 Wednesday morning I cooked the last of my oatmeal and ate
    a hurried breakfast. I then gathered up my stuff and prepared to
    leave my home of the past few days. I said good-bye to my overhang
    and left for the instructor’s camp at 6:30. At about 7 they began to
    rappel the rest of those that hadn’t done it on Saturday. The cliff
    was about 140 feet high and was nearly vertical except for the last
    20 feet at the bottom where the cliff face jutted inward sharply.
    This meant that the last 20 feet of descending was in mid-air,
    dangling by the ropes. I went down very slowly and carefully to
    enjoy it as long as I could. It was over all too soon. They finished
    rappelling the rest of us by 11:30.</p>
    <p>At about noon we all met together under some big cottonwood trees
    for our final testimony meeting. The spirit of the Lord was very
    strong, and we shared our love for each other for 4 hours. I will
    never forget the special feeling I had at that meeting. It made all
    the hardship and suffering of the past month seem worthwhile. After
    the meeting we had another special treat. A church member sister
    from Boulder had baked us about 15 loaves of home-made whole wheat
    bread with two big cubes of real butter. Each of us were given 2 and
    a half thick slices with great gobs of peanut butter and jam smeared
    all over them. Then we built a big fire and cooked up a big pot of
    chunky chicken soup. Most of us thought we had died and gone to
    heaven. That meal was our first solid food that tasted like a
    civilized meal for a whole month. Then we had a fireside that
    evening. We sang songs, had skits, and were given awards. I was
    given the mouse-keeper award for my tender care of my pet mouse
    during solo. Then Chuck explained to us about the run-in to Boulder
    in the morning. We were to get up at 4am and be ready to leave camp
    by 5:30. For a final surprise before going to bed, the staff made us
    a big pot of hot chocolate and give us each a candy bar. We were
    then expected to get some rest before the ordeal in the morning, but
    most of the kids stayed up and talked late into the night, nervously
    anticipating the run-in and our entrance back into civilization.</p>
    <p>At 4 in the morning, we woke up to GT Joe giving everyone orders
    to get up and get moving. Many were reluctant to face this day and
    we didn’t leave camp until 6:30. We were to walk to the top of the
    hill where we would start running the 11 miles into Boulder. At
    precisely 7 a.m. the gun went off and the boys cheered the girls as
    they took off down the road. At 7:15 the gun went off again for the
    boys. For the first quarter mile I stayed with the pack sizing up
    who would be the hardest ones to beat and seeing how the pace felt.
    It felt a little slow, so I began to leave them behind. After 10
    minutes of running, I never saw another boy until the end when they
    came into Boulder. I started passing the first of the girls after 20
    minutes of running. They were very sweet and encouraged me to keep
    it up. After 4 ½ miles of easy downhill and level running I was
    surprised to cross Deer Creek. That first half hour of running had
    seemed so easy. Most of the rest of the way was up hill and I began
    to feel the strain. After 45 minutes I began to feel cramps in my
    legs and my breathing was very heavy and labored. I had to walk up
    some of the steeper hills. I kept passing girls, but I knew I would
    not be first until I passed the girl I knew would be in the
    lead.</p>
    <p>After an hour and 20 minutes I finally sighted her a quarter mile
    ahead. By this time, I was really hurting, and it gave me a boost of
    energy to see Suzy. As I passed her, I smiled and said, “I love you,
    Suzy”. It was only another 5 minutes when I rounded a bend to find
    the first buildings of Boulder. I shouted for joy as I ran up to the
    chapel and collapsed into the arms of Chuck at 8:46. I had run the
    12 miles in 1 hour and 31 minutes, 9 minutes from the record time. I
    had revived somewhat and was walking slowly around to keep my
    muscles from cramping when Suzy came in 5 minutes behind me. Kids
    kept coming in for the next hour and a half, the last one coming in
    at 10 am. By 10:45 we were loaded on the bus and heading back toward
    Provo. We stopped in Richfield where everyone went crazy buying food
    at a Safeway store there. We arrived in Provo at 5 pm where we
    unloaded at the Richards PE building.</p>
    <p>There were many tears and hugs and happy reunions with parents.
    We all said our good-byes and went our separate ways until we would
    meet again at the party Friday at 10 am.</p>
