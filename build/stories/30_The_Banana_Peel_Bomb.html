    <h1>The Banana Peel Bomb</h1>
    <p>Fast forward about 30 years. We lived in Maine. I was married and
    had 4 children. I guess I was having a mid-life revival of my
    childhood love of pyrotechnics. It was all the kid&#39;s fault,
    actually. I bought a few model rocket kits to fly with the kids.
    That was what rekindled the firebug in me. This quickly escalated
    into wanting to build bigger and more powerful rockets. The internet
    was just starting to be a great source for a lot of interesting
    knowledge and a way to buy mail-order chemicals to feed the
    curiosity.<br />
    <br />
    My goal was to design and build my own rocket motors. I was no
    longer content to buy the feeble little black powder motors you
    could get for model rockets in the local hobby stores. I was a
    mighty engineer and I could do better. After considerable research,
    I decided to try a formula I found in the on-line literature. The
    problem was that the rocket motor design required quite a bit of
    specially fabricated metal parts. I had neither the skill nor the
    tools to do this kind of work, but I knew someone who did. Brother
    Bibber was a machinist by trade and was willing to help me achieve
    my goal by doing the machining. I gave him the drawings and waited.
    It was nearly 3 months before he had the time to make my parts, but
    finally, he delivered a shoe box of beautifully crafted rocket motor
    parts. The design consisted of a piece of chromium-molybdenum pipe
    with threads at both ends. The concept required cylindrical shaped
    castings of rocket fuel that were placed inside the pipe container
    and then the end pieces were screwed on to enclose the solid rocket
    fuel. It was not much different than those silly home-made bullets I
    made as a child. It was still basically a fancy pipe-bomb, just a
    lot bigger and a lot more expensive. However, I was still just as
    naïve to believe my newest incarnation would work perfectly the
    first time.<br />
    <br />
    I thought my test plan was reasonable. I wanted to do a static test
    firing of the new motor design. I built a wooden test stand out of
    scraps of lumber. This stand was supposed to hold the motor in a
    stationary position while it was fired. This would allow me to
    demonstrate that the motor would actually develop enough thrust to
    cause a rocket to fly. After a successful static test, I would then
    use it to send a rocket into the sky.<br />
    <br />
    On the fateful day of the static test, I set up the test stand in
    the driveway in front of the garage. I loaded the assembled motor
    into the test stand and installed an electric ignitor. I called the
    kids to come see the test and we all stood about 10 feet away from
    the test stand as I pushed the button to ignite the motor. It worked
    beautifully for about 10 milliseconds and then went kaboom with a
    bright flash of fire and smoke. My test stand, which was constructed
    of sturdy 4-by-4&#39;s, was blown into a cloud of tooth-pick sized
    splinters of wood. The motor itself was nowhere to be seen. I just
    disappeared into thin air. I finally found it a few days later when
    I spied it on top of the garage roof. After retrieving the motor
    from its perch on the roof, I realized how incredibly lucky we had
    been. The rocket motor looked like superman had opened it like a
    banana. One end of the motor casing had split open and the sides of
    the tube were bent back just like a half-eaten banana.<br />
    <br />
    It was evident from the shape of the wreckage that the metal alloy
    had been able to burst open without splintering into deadly metal
    shrapnel that might have seriously injured me or one of my children.
    This is when it finally dawned on me that I was incredibly lucky and
    still had rather poor judgement when it came to assessing the risks
    of doing pyrotechnic experiments. Furthermore, my beautifully
    machined metal parts, for which I had waited anxiously for many
    months, had been totally destroyed in an instant. It put a serious
    damper on my enthusiasm to become an amateur rocket scientist.<br />
    <br />
    This dramatic failure caused me to take a new direction in my
    pyrotechnic experimentation. I decided that rockets were too
    complicated. I would use the chemicals I had purchased to make
    fireworks instead. This kind of skill didn&#39;t require so many
    expensive tools and complicated parts. Most of the fireworks could
    be made with common cardboard tubes and glue. Thus, fate had sent me
    on a whole new kind of hobby pursuit. However, it didn&#39;t do much to
    lessen the likelihood that I would still experience epic failures.
    As you will soon see, my list of pyrotechnic failures was only just
    beginning.</p>
