        <h1>Ricochet Rockets in the Basement</h1>
        <p>Life Lesson: Cleanliness and organization are good habits</p>
        <p>The fireworks lab was in the basement in our home in Windham,
        Maine. I was not yet very tidy down there and often left odds
        and ends from long past projects lying around on the workbench.
        It was on a Saturday when this next little fiasco occurred. Lori
        was away from the house for some unknown reason, but at least
        some of the children were home. However, I was working alone in
        the basement at the time. I don&#39;t remember what I was even
        working on, but I was using my electric grinding wheel to
        sharpen or shape some piece of metal. The nature of grinding
        wheels is that they quite often produce a lot of bright metal
        sparks shooting out the back side of the grinding wheel.<br />
        <br />
        Now, normally, this is not a real fire hazard because the sparks
        are not hot enough to start fires or even cause damage to the
        surrounding surface of the work bench. However, I had left a
        paper cup of flammable powder of some kind on the work bench. It
        was left over from some other project and never properly
        disposed of. After many months of sitting on the back of the
        work bench, I didn&#39;t even take notice of the cup or what
        dangerous substance might still be lurking inside. As you can
        guess, the sparks from the grinding wheel ignited this cup of
        powder and caused a large poof of flame that startled me quite a
        bit. This was not the end of the incident, however. Lying next
        to the paper cup were a few fireworks rockets. They were meant
        for large stick rockets, a lot like bottle rockets, but much
        larger. Whereas bottle rockets are about one and a half inches
        long and attached to a foot long stick, my stick rockets were
        about six inches long and normally would be attached to
        3-foot-long sticks. Well, the flash and flame from the paper cup
        caused the fuses of the rockets to ignite and before I could
        react they were flying around in the basement, ricocheting off
        the walls and ceiling just like a Wiley Coyote cartoon. The
        whole basement quickly filled up with smoke and then the smoke
        alarm started wailing.<br />
        <br />
        All this racket caused Megan to wonder what was going on in the
        basement. She opened the door to the basement, only to discover
        it was filled with smoke and the alarm was still making an
        ear-piercing noise. About this time, I finally got my wits about
        me and quickly told Megan to close the door so the smoke
        wouldn&#39;t go upstairs. My first act to recover from this disaster
        was to grab a pillow and stuff it around the fire alarm to
        deafen the awful noise. Then I opened the patio door to let the
        smoke go outside. Gradually, the smoke cleared and the fire
        alarm stopped its annoying wail. It was then I realized that
        some sparks of some kind had managed to get under the cuff of my
        shirt and caused a nasty burn. I still have a nice little scar
        on my arm that reminds me of my stupidity to this day.
        Fortunately, no other harm was caused by the incident and I
        again considered myself very lucky that I escaped with only a
        bit of a burn on my arm.<br />
        <br />
        From this scary incident, I learned that cleanliness and
        organization are good habits to have when working with
        explosives. A little carelessness on one day can cause a serious
        accident to sneak up on you many days in the future when you
        least expect it to happen. Alas, my lesson still didn&#39;t prevent
        other fiascos to follow.</p>
