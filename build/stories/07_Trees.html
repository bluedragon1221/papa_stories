    <h1>Trees</h1>
    <p>Trees have influenced my life many times over the years. This
    little memoir attempts to organize all my significant tree
    experiences into one place. The motivation for this odd little
    treatise is that the item “Plant a tree” is on my life’s bucket
    list. After pondering about the trees I have planted, I decided to
    expand the topic to other aspects of interaction with trees
    also.</p>
    <p>My first memory of a tree experience comes from my earliest
    childhood playground. My family lived in a small white house in
    Lakeview, Oregon in 1958. We lived next to a kind old woman we
    referred to as Granny Green. In her back yard there was an ancient
    apple tree. It was large enough to support the weight of a
    5-year-old boy who was learning to be like Tarzan of the jungle. I
    remember spending many lazy summer days in that back yard either
    under the tree or up in it. I hope to see Granny Green again someday
    in Heaven to thank her for those pleasant memories and her kindness
    to me and my siblings.</p>
    <h2 id="treehouses">Treehouses</h2>
    <p>Every healthy child must have a tree house embedded in his
    childhood at some point. My first one belongs to the period when my
    family lived in Oregon City in an old farm-house we rented for about
    a year or so. This would have been about 1964 when I was in the 5th
    grade of elementary school. There was a large old cherry tree in the
    spacious back yard of that farmhouse, not too far from a huge barn
    full of smelly old hay, bugs, pigeons and ancient farm equipment.
    The cherry tree had a few large branches that extended nearly
    parallel to the ground at a height of about 12 feet. With a ladder
    and some sophisticated engineering skills, my brother and I managed
    to place a few planks of wood across those branches to form a crude
    platform. This platform hardly qualified as a true treehouse, but it
    was our first attempt at this kind of construction, and we were
    still learning the skill. It was just large enough for two small
    children to sit on and contemplate the vast world below us. The
    comforts of this treehouse were fairly meager, but occasionally we
    could eat fresh cherries without leaving the living room.</p>
    <p>My next attempt at building a treehouse was considerably more
    sophisticated. I can’t claim all the credit for the engineering
    marvel we created because our friend Dan Kraus filled the role of
    lead construction engineer in this project. I’m guessing I was about
    16 years old by this time because I remember going to a lumber mill
    with “Old Blue”, our old blue Chevrolet station wagon that had been
    in the family since the dawn of time. We paid them a dollar for all
    the lumber scraps we could jam into the cargo hold of that station
    wagon. It was perfect for creating the treehouse of our dreams.</p>
    <p>Dan Kraus chose a great location for the treehouse. It was
    located near the top of a steep drop-off that descended about 100
    feet to the river bottoms below. This land was part of the original
    60 acres that my father bought when I was about 14 years old. He
    built the family home about 1/4 mile away at the top of a hill
    overlooking the river valley below. We found a clump of maple trees
    that were perfect for our treehouse. There were 4 big tree trunks
    that rose toward the sky roughly in the shape of a 4-pointed
    diamond. Two of the trunks in the middle of the diamond were only
    about 18 inches apart, but the other two trunks at the top and
    bottom of the diamond were about 6 feet apart. The floorplan of the
    treehouse is shown below.</p>

    <p>As you can see from the drawing above, there is a square hole in
    the floor between the two tree trunks that were close together. This
    hole was the door to the treehouse. The only way to get into the
    treehouse was to come up from below the floor and squeeze through
    the hole in the floor. It was not the best arrangement for invited
    guests and visiting dignitaries, but we weren’t too worried about
    those issues when we designed the treehouse. Now this was no
    ordinary treehouse in other ways too. The bottom section of the
    floor (as shown in the drawing above) was the living room and it had
    sides that rose about 6 feet and then it had a roof over it. The top
    section was open to the air because it had no sides, just a couple
    of boards to act as guard rails. This area was the veranda. We also
    put up guard rails on the tree trunks above the living room so you
    could climb up there and be on the lookout for pirates coming up the
    river. We called this upper room the “crow’s nest” because you could
    see a large marsh and lots of water-fowl in the river bottoms below
    us. The view was amazing and made us feel like we were the kings of
    a vast kingdom of wild and untamed wilderness below. I wish we had
    taken a picture of this treehouse. It was a source of great pride
    for about one summer. Then other things like girls and cars become
    more important and the treehouse was left to rot in the forest.</p>
    <h2 id="climbing-trees">Climbing Trees</h2>
    <p>I can remember two specific times when I nearly met with disaster
    when I climbed a tree. The first happened at the same home where we
    built our first tree house. There was an old apple tree near the
    house that had a huge limb that extended quite far over the ground
    20 feet below. I loved to climb out to the end of that limb and
    bounce up and down. The limb would sway up and down about 4 feet. I
    thought I was like a cowboy riding a wild stallion in the air. I was
    too young and foolish to consider that I might be overstressing the
    structural strength of that tree limb. I just knew it was a lot of
    fun and wanted to impress others with my bravery and climbing
    skills. On one occasion, I was riding the wild stallion when my
    father came out in the yard. I yelled to him to watch what I could
    do in the tree. I threw all my weight into the effort to make the
    show as impressive as possible. Suddenly there was a sharp crack as
    the large tree limb finally gave up and broke under the strain. Now
    all my bravery evaporated, and I screamed like a little girl as the
    broken limb and I fell to the ground below. Fortunately, I didn’t
    break any bones, but my pride was considerably bruised as my dad ran
    over to assess the damage. When he found that I wasn’t hurt, he just
    chuckled and said, “Well, I guess you learned a valuable lesson
    about how gravity works, Dan.”</p>
    <p>The second memorable occasion when I climbed a tree illustrates
    that I didn’t learn very much from the first memorable tree-climbing
    incident. We lived in a rented house in Vancouver when I was about
    10 years old. The neighbors across the road had a small pasture for
    a horse out behind their house. Located in the pasture was one of
    the largest fir trees I had ever seen. It rose about 80 feet into
    the air and was probably over 100 years old. To me it seemed like
    the magic bean stalk from the fairy tale “Jack and the Bean Stalk”.
    I often wondered what the world would look like from the top of that
    huge old fir tree. I finally worked up the courage to attempt the
    climb and found it to be quite easy. There were plenty of limbs to
    grab ahold of as I ascended to the top. I never really felt any
    great fear as I climbed up that tree. I didn’t tell anybody about my
    daring climb because I was fairly certain that my parents wouldn’t
    approve. I made it up to the top of that tree where the trunk was
    not very large and decided that was far enough. I had proved I could
    do it and I was ready to come back down. One false move and I would
    certainly have fallen to my death from about 80 feet in the air. If
    you were one of my children or grandchildren watching from heaven,
    you might have had reason for great concern. After all, I was not
    only risking my own life, but all of yours too. You might still be
    stuck in heaven waiting for your next ticket to come to earth
    because your foolish grandpa fell out of that tree and broke his
    neck. Anyway, you are reading this story, so I must have been
    OK.</p>
    <h2 id="planting-trees">Planting Trees</h2>
    <p>The first trees I planted are possibly a whole forest of fir
    trees now, but I will likely never know. The first summer after I
    returned home from Brazil, I was hired to plant fir trees on a piece
    of logged off land owned by Jim Granger, a good friend of my father.
    I’m not sure, but I seem to remember that there was a government
    grant program that encouraged people to replant their land with
    trees after the mature lumber trees had been harvested by the
    logging companies. Accordingly, Brother Granger obtained hundreds of
    young fir seedlings and hired me and another college student to
    plant them. I remember trudging over the hills for many hours with a
    bundle of young trees and a shovel. It was back-breaking work, but
    it was somewhat satisfying to think we were contributing to a
    program that would make the world a more beautiful place. Hour after
    hour I pushed the shovel into the ground, pushed it over to the side
    to create a space in the soil, shoved a seedling into the opening,
    removed the shovel, stomped on the dirt around the young tree, then
    took three steps and repeated the same sequence. I’ve often wondered
    what ever happened to those trees, but I never had a chance to go
    back there again.</p>
    <p>The next trees I planted were in American Fork, Utah. Lori and I
    had purchased a starter home in a small neighborhood next to the
    railroad track and the freeway. After the house was built and the
    yard was planted in grass, I planted two red-leafed ornamental maple
    trees in the front yard along with a northern pecan tree beside the
    driveway. In the back yard I planted a peach tree, a red delicious
    apple tree and two cherry trees. They were all part of an ambitious
    back yard garden plan that included strawberries, raspberries,
    asparagus and a vegetable plot.</p>
    <p>We waited for several years while the fruit trees grew big enough
    to finally start growing fruit. About the third or fourth year
    later, the apple tree burst forth with hundreds of white blossoms
    after the winter finally gave way to spring. Lori and I were so
    excited to see all those blossoms because they meant we would soon
    enjoy the delight of harvesting our first apples from that tree.
    Alas, it was not to be. A few days later, I came home from work to
    learn that Emily, our oldest daughter, had climbed into the tree and
    picked every last one of those blossoms off the tree. I guess she
    was making “popcorn balls that would smell so sweet” or some silly
    thing, but she managed to totally collect every single one of those
    little white blossoms. Needless to say, she got in big trouble for
    her sinister prank. Her punishment was that she had to give me her
    most precious stuffed animal for the rest of the year. I felt that
    she needed to understand what it felt like to lose something that
    was very important to her. Then she might understand what she had
    taken from me. Perhaps I over-reacted a little, but it seemed to
    make some kind of twisted sense at the time.</p>
    <h2 id="living-with-trees-in-maine">Living with Trees in Maine</h2>
    <p>My family moved to the state of Maine in 1989. We lived on an
    acre and a half of forest. It was composed of mostly Eastern white
    pine trees with a little bit of oak mixed in. One scruffy giant was
    directly in front of the house beside the driveway into the garage.
    It was ancient and knobby, but interesting to look at. Due to the
    location of the house, we seldom experienced much direct sunlight
    because of all the trees.</p>
    <p>I did plant a spruce tree in the forest there, but only because
    it was a gift and I didn’t know what else to do with it. Now, I
    always enjoy the opportunity to plant a tree, but while I lived
    within such an abundance of trees already, I decided it would also
    be a bit of fun to cut one down. Allow me to explain.</p>
    <p>After one particularly long and cold winter, we discovered that
    one of the trees in the forest had died. We had a wood burning stove
    in the house, so I decided I would cut down that dead tree and use
    it for fuel in our stove. The technique is fairly simple, but
    fraught with an element of danger. Trees as big as the dead one are
    large enough to cause a great deal of damage if they fall on
    something like a house. Therefore, I studied the problem for quite a
    while and came up with a plan to make the tree fall in just the
    right direction to avoid any harm to myself or the forest. I used my
    trusty Stihl chain saw to cut a notch at the base of the tree on the
    side where I wanted it to fall. Then I made the final cut on the
    opposite side of the tree and watched with apprehension as the old
    giant slowly started to lean and fall. It gathered more and more
    momentum as it continued to fall, but the direction of the fall
    wasn’t precisely what I had tried so hard to engineer. There was a
    young tree about 40 feet tall and 8 inches in diameter in the path
    of the falling giant. The big tree snapped the smaller tree just
    like a little toothpick and hit the ground with a whoosh and a big
    thump. The ground shook from the impact and there were a lot of
    frightening snapping sounds as tree branches splintered and flew in
    the air. I breathed a sigh of relief after the dust settled and I
    could see that no one had been sent to heaven with my little logging
    stunt. I have to admit that the excitement and the suspense of the
    experience got my heart rate up pretty high. I could get used to
    that kind of destructive fun.</p>
    <p>Finally, I’ll conclude my little epistle about trees with a
    description of the ice storm. Probably somewhere in the vicinity of
    1995 we had an unusual weather phenomenon where the air was freezing
    cold at ground level, but not at higher altitudes. The moisture in
    the air condensed into rain which froze into solid ice upon reaching
    the ground. The ice formed on everything to a depth of about an
    inch. It turned everything in the forest into a magical crystal
    garden. This rare spectacle would have been quite delightful to
    experience except for the fact that the weight of the ice caused a
    terrible destruction of the trees in the forest. When we woke up on
    the first morning after the ice storm, the view outside looked like
    a war zone. Many of the trees had fallen over due to the tremendous
    weight of the ice on their branches. One large oak tree on the other
    side of the road in front of our house split right down the middle.
    Fortunately, none of the falling trees caused any damage to our
    house, but I can’t say the same for the power lines that brought us
    life-saving electricity in the winter months. Most of the power
    distribution system in the whole state of Maine had been badly
    damaged. The consequence was that we were completely without any
    electricity for a period of 5 days. We managed to keep the house
    warm by burning wood in our stove, but this only kept the family
    room warm, while the rest of the house was like living in a
    refrigerator. I remember that the greatest hardship was not having
    any light in the house in the evening. We had a few candles to make
    a little bit of feeble light, but it was difficult to even read a
    book in those conditions.</p>
    <p>The other frightening thing I remember was the noise in the
    night-time. While I was in my bed trying to sleep, I was often
    awoken by the sound of crashing branches in the forest. Many of the
    branches of the pine trees had hundreds of pounds of ice clinging to
    them. All this weight caused a curious thing to happen to the trees.
    The branches would literally be pulled out of the trunk of the
    trees. Whenever a branch finally lost its battle with gravity, there
    would be a sharp cracking sound followed by a thundering crash as
    the branch and hundreds of pounds of ice plummeted to the forest
    floor. It was difficult to sleep under these conditions. All night
    long the forest echoed with the sound of crashing ice avalanches as
    the trees were decimated by the load of ice. I can imagine it might
    have been like the bombing raids that were conducted at night during
    the world wars.</p>
    <p>Finally, after 5 days, the power was restored and life moved on.
    The experience certainly made me appreciate the simple things we had
    to do without when there was no power. I could go on and on. Trees
    are still a big part of my life in the state of Washington. They are
    a fascinating form of life that brings beauty and richness to my
    mortal experience.</p>
