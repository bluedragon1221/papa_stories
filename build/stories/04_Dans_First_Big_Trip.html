    <h1>Dan’s First Big Trip</h1>
    <p>Big adventures that took us far from home were not a part of my
    early childhood years. We had lots of family events near home with
    grandparents, uncles and aunts, cousins and church friends, but
    expensive far away trips were out of our reach. I had no sense of
    deprivation or disappointment because I was just a small child and
    my world in the vicinity of Lakeview was enormous. There was never a
    lack of things to explore and challenging things to do, so life was
    good.</p>
    <p>I remember lots of little trips around the area. Dad loved to
    shoot guns and we often went to shoot jack rabbits at the airport
    and ground squirrels at grandpa Williams’ farm. Family hikes in the
    surrounding hills and fishing in the local streams were common.</p>
    <p>The first actual vacation trip that I can remember was a family
    trip to Disneyland when we lived in Oregon City. We did lots of
    things as a family to earn some extra money for the event. Because
    we lived in an old farm house where there were still a few surviving
    trees from the original orchards, we were able to gather up a large
    pile of walnuts that had fallen on the ground beneath the trees. Dad
    placed them on some drying racks in the basement until they were dry
    enough to remove the outer skins and then crack the shells to
    harvest the nuts inside. I remember sitting with the family in the
    basement and cracking those walnuts for hours while we listened to
    music from an old radio. After all our efforts to earn extra cash
    for the trip, I think we managed to save up about 76 dollars.</p>
    <p>The trip was memorable, but full of boring stuff too. The
    traveling in Old Blue, the family station wagon, seemed endless and
    I remember being stuck in traffic for what seemed forever. We had to
    stand in line for hours to go on a 15-minute ride. I only remember
    the submarine ride and the Matterhorn. The crowds and cars and big
    city were all a bit overwhelming for a young boy from the country. I
    came back from the experience wondering what the big attraction of
    it was. I’d rather build forts in the old prune dryer and catch
    crawdads in the local stream than fight with the crowds in the big
    city.</p>
    <p>A loving, supportive family with lots of siblings and extended
    family were enough to build a world of happiness for me. I never
    felt that I needed to escape from the local village to see the
    wonders of the world. I was content with the simple life of a
    country boy from the sticks.</p>
