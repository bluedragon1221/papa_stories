        <h1>Survival Journal - Final Paper</h1>
        <p><em>Since the experience of the past month has been a period
        of great learning for me, this paper will be an attempt to
        express the lessons I have learned from survival. Hopefully, it
        will be a summary of my thoughts and realizations as I have come
        to understand them during solo.</em></p>
        <p>From the hardships and tests of endurance I learned much
        about my limitations. Strangely though, I learned more from
        observing others than myself. The first realization came when we
        left the little pond at the mouth of Horsethief during impact. I
        thought I had nearly reached my limits as we hiked that day and
        was extremely reluctant to continue on. Then as I was given the
        opportunity to help Melody and saw how tired she was, but how
        determinately she continued on I knew that I had not even come
        close to my limits of endurance. Throughout many of the tests of
        survival I have felt that my trials have not been as severe as
        those of others and each time I knew that if they had the
        courage to carry on surely, I must also.</p>
        <p>One of the greatest lessons I have learned is the role that
        humility must play in my life. During group ex. it was humbling
        to see how well the girls groups performed together compared to
        the boys groups. An essential part of cooperating as a group is
        having the humility to put your trust in a leader and his
        decisions. We boys were too individualistic and did not function
        well as a group until we were humbled by becoming separated.
        Humility also is an essential element in a person’s relationship
        to the Lord. Only when a person has enough humility to know that
        he must depend upon the Lord instead of his own strength, can he
        earnestly strive to seek the help and guidance he needs. This
        lesson was not fully realized by me until the end of survival
        week when I felt sufficiently humble. I now have a better
        understanding of how much I must depend upon the Lord not only
        during times of hardship, but in all walks of life.</p>
        <p>Survival has also taught me a lesson of appreciation for the
        sacred privilege of living in this beautiful creation. During
        solo I witnessed many wonders, from the graceful motions of deer
        and great hawks to the delicate scampering of field mice and
        insects. I often studied the canyon walls and remembered back to
        the other beautiful landscapes I had seen during the past month.
        I had time to appreciate their immensity and perhaps more fully
        understand how all these things are filling the “measure of
        their</p>
        <p>creation”, as Sharon said. My eyes have beheld many of these
        marvels before, but I was not a part of them and could not fully
        appreciate them. It was as if I looked at them only through a
        picture frame until I had this chance to experience some of the
        joys and pains of living so intimately amongst them. For this
        added appreciation of the sacred blessing of earthly existence I
        am most grateful.</p>
        <p>Some of the lessons I have learned are in relation to the
        goals I set, at the beginning of the course. One of my goals was
        to learn to base friendships upon the inner qualities of people
        rather than on outward appearances or superficial, less eternal
        qualities. From this experience of knowing hardships and
        suffering, of depending upon and living so closely with people I
        did not previously know, I feel I have learned how to more
        easily recognize the qualities upon which I want to base love
        for others. I am continually amazed at how much I can find to
        love in every single person I have met, during survival. I feel
        I have a greater understanding of Christ’s love for all his
        children and His commandment that we are to love others as we do
        ourselves. Another of my goals was to overcome my selfishness or
        to learn to love others to the point that I cared more about
        them than I did myself. From the many opportunities I had to
        serve others and give of myself I learned much about myself. I
        do not feel that I gave as much as I could or that I have
        overcome all my selfish desires, but I have learned much about
        where my faults lie and what I must do to correct them.</p>
        <p>To summarize my feelings from survival, I have come to know a
        great peace within myself. It is not a peace such that what I am
        is entirely what want to be, but the lessons I have learned and
        the knowledge of myself I have gained do not disturb me, but
        confirm my faith in myself. I feel a sense of accomplishment at
        having endured hardships and having born them without faltering.
        I feel, too, that the direction I am going after survival will
        enable me to apply what I have learned toward improving</p>
        <p>myself. I will be able to increase my faith in the Lord and
        learn to more fully love and serve others during my mission to
        Brazil. I am extremely grateful to have had this chance to learn
        so much that will serve as preparation for mission my
        experience.</p>
        <p>As far as an instructor critique, I’m afraid I have little to
        say. Throughout the entire month of survival I never at any time
        felt a lacking on the part of the instructors. Their total
        dedication to their responsibility always seemed more than
        sufficient to me. The two instructors with which I had the most
        contact and whom I learned to love and appreciate the most were
        Fred and Russ. I feel that they both gave me much more than
        could give in return and that they both did an excellent job of
        teaching what they were. I will be eternally grateful to them
        and all the instructors for making survival the great experience
        it was to me.</p>
