        <h1>Dem Bones</h1>
        <p>Thankfully, I’ve never suffered a broken bone in my life, but
        Lori and several of our children have. The most recent
        occurrence was Lori’s wobbly-rock incident at Girl’s Camp that
        resulted in a shiny new stainless-steel plate in her left wrist.
        She now has a small collection of metal objects in her body, but
        I’m not the least bit jealous. I think perhaps the artificial
        lenses in my eyes trump the metal she has in her wrist and
        hip.<br />
        <br />
        Lori’s broken wrist got me to pondering over the children’s
        broken bones. I’ve decided to write about the time Emily broke
        her arm. I think there is a life lesson in there somewhere, but
        only where you would least expect it.<br />
        <br />
        We were living in our first house in American Fork, Utah. It was
        a starter house neighborhood with mostly young families and tons
        of young children roaming the neighborhood. Emily was probably
        about 5 years old at the time. As young kids will do, Emily had
        climbed a fence and was demonstrating her balancing skills by
        walking like a tight rope walker along the top of the fence. I
        don’t remember who the culprit was, but some other neighborhood
        child thought it would be funny to chuck his shoe at Emily in an
        attempt to make her fall off the fence. I don’t even know if he
        was successful in hitting his target, but he was successful at
        making Emily fall off the fence. She came home with her forearm
        bent at an impossible angle. It was quite apparent that some
        bones had been broken and we needed to get her to the emergency
        room in a hurry.<br />
        <br />
        Not having a sitter for the other kids, Lori and I loaded up the
        other two children and Emily in the car and headed to the
        hospital. The treatment for the broken arm seemed rather bizarre
        to me. They put Emily’s fingers in metal springs that worked
        like Chinese handcuffs to suspend her hand in the air. They then
        hung a bucket from her elbow and started adding water to it to
        use the weight to stretch her forearm as they tried to re-align
        the broken bones prior to adding the cast. I believe they gave
        Emily some laughing gas to calm her down, but it didn’t work and
        she was making a pretty big fuss the whole time. It was all very
        stressful to watch my own child suffer so much and the procedure
        was taking a very long time. Lori suggested that she could stay
        with Emily at the hospital and I could take the other children
        back home. My nerves were a little bit frazzled by the harrowing
        experience so I was glad to comply with the suggestion.<br />
        <br />
        I took Ryan and Megan back to the car and loaded them into the
        back seat. Now this was before the days when seat belts and
        child car seats were required and my children were quite used to
        roaming free whenever they were in the car with us. It was also
        before we were affluent enough to afford a car with
        air-conditioning, so the windows were down as we left the
        hospital parking lot. Not long after leaving the parking lot, I
        could see Megan in my rear-view mirror. She was standing on the
        seat and quite happy with herself for her accomplishment.
        Recognizing that this was a dangerous thing for a three-year-old
        to do and not wanting to have to pay for two broken bones on the
        same day, I told her fairly firmly to sit down on the seat. Well
        Megan wasn’t about to comply while she was quite enjoying her
        newly discovered ability to see the world go by from a much
        better vantage point. I told her again with even more volume and
        probably a good deal of anger in my voice to sit down. Again, no
        result.<br />
        <br />
        Because I was driving and Megan was in the back seat, I realized
        I couldn’t do much under these circumstances to enforce my
        command to my non-compliant child. So, with a bit of steam
        coming out of my ears, I pulled over to the curb and braked hard
        to bring the car to a stop. I turned around and yelled, “Megan,
        sit down!” as I rather roughly pushed her into a sitting
        position in the back seat. Megan wasn’t any too thrilled about
        this kind of treatment and immediately started to holler over
        the affront to her 3-year-old dignity.<br />
        <br />
        Satisfied I had reaffirmed that my authority was not to be
        trifled with, I looked up and discovered I had stopped right in
        front of a house where some kind of barbeque event was going on
        in the front yard. Everyone in the party was looking at me with
        a look of shock and horror on their faces. I was totally
        mortified to realize that they all had witnessed my little
        tirade in front of their house. Fortunately, this was before the
        days when everyone had cell phones and took videos of such
        spectacles so they could go viral on the internet. However, my
        shame at being caught in the act by so many witnesses was such
        that I determined to high-tail it out of there as fast as I
        could. I put the car in gear and put the pedal to the metal to
        make my get-away.<br />
        <br />
        Thinking about this memory more than 30 years later, I can
        recognize the life lesson I didn’t really learn at the time of
        its occurrence. I wasn’t really mortified by my lack of
        gentleness and patience with Megan. I was mostly mortified that
        my little outburst had been seen by others. I wonder how I would
        have behaved if I had remembered that everything we do here in
        mortality is being observed by someone. It all goes into the
        Book of Life and becomes a part of the permanent record. Our
        choices become a part of our soul and the cumulative effect
        determines who we become. I think this is one reason why
        marriage is such a vital part of this mortal experience. We have
        a built-in witness to our lives and a greater motivation to try
        to behave well in front of our companion on the covenant
        path.</p>
