    <h1>A Critter in the House</h1>
    <p>Life Lesson: Compassion and Forgiveness are better than
    anger.</p>
    <p>This story happened in the Maine house, probably about 1996. As
    far as I can remember, I was the only person at home, which was a
    very rare occasion. I could be just making it all up because I have
    no corroborating witnesses, but I swear it really happened.</p>
    <p>I was upstairs in the bedroom at the time and I heard a lot of
    commotion going on in another room. It sounded like the patter of
    little feet that were running very fast. There were two sets of
    footsteps, like something was chasing something else. It seemed to
    start in an upstairs bedroom and then I could tell the chase
    proceeded down the stairs at breakneck speed, much faster than any
    human could go. Alarmed, I started walking down the stairs to try to
    figure out what kind of skirmish was ensuing in my house and causing
    such a ruckus. As I neared the bottom of the stairs, I caught a
    glimpse of our cat. She was racing as fast as she could go to catch
    up to a critter of some kind. They were tearing all around the
    house, under the furniture, out to the kitchen and back to the
    living room. I could only stand at the bottom of the stairs and
    watch dumb-founded as the race continued. Finally, as the running
    animals neared where I was standing, the cat caught up with the
    critter and it looked like a ball of fur with a few tails sticking
    out. It was just like I used to see in cartoons when a dog and a cat
    were fighting. I had no idea what to do to save the poor little
    critter that our cat was determined to vanquish, so I just held my
    stupefied gaze.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the cat popped out of the ball of fur and landed on her
    feet stone-still. The other critter was now on its back, also
    stone-still, with its feet pointing skyward. It was almost like the
    cat called time-out so the two could catch their breath before the
    next round of the battle. Now I could see that the victim the cat
    was chasing was a flying squirrel. It was a beautiful little
    creature with snow-white under fur, a brown back and long brown
    tail. The cat was looking up at me as if to say, “Look what I
    flushed out of the shadows in our house, but don’t worry, I got
    this!” I looked down at the little beastie with sympathy. I thought
    the cat must have killed it because it wasn’t moving. I reached down
    and picked it up by the tail. I took a few steps over to the front
    entry door and opened it to set the creature down on the landing of
    the front steps. The squirrel was still acting quite dead, not
    moving a muscle. However, before I had a chance to let go of its
    tail, the squirrel called time-in. Much to my amazement, he was able
    to swing his body up and sink his teeth into the fleshy tip of my
    thumb, which was still pinching the end of his tail.</p>
    <p>Now, my reaction time was many times slower than that of the
    squirrel, but when the message finally arrived at my brain about 15
    milliseconds later, panic took over. I jerked my hand back, but the
    squirrel was still attached to it. Next, I flung my hand away,
    trying to dislodge the little critter who seemed determined to hang
    on for dear life. This time, however, it worked and the squirrel let
    go. He landed on the threshold of the open front door. I quickly
    slammed the door closed to prevent the squirrel from coming back in.
    Thinking the ordeal was over, I examined my thumb to assess the
    damage. I went back upstairs to clean the wound and finish
    dressing.</p>
    <p>About five minutes later, I came back down the stairs. I had a
    band-aid on my thumb, but my indignation and mental state were still
    somewhat inflamed. At the bottom of the stairs, I found the cat near
    the closed front door. She was intently staring at the spot where
    the squirrel had landed on the threshold of the door. Then I heard a
    faint skritch, skritch on the other side of the door. I waited a
    moment and listened intently. There it was again, an unmistakable
    scratching noise coming from the other side of the door. I thought
    to myself, “Seriously! Is that crazy squirrel still trying to invade
    my house to even the score with the mean old cat?” I went through
    the kitchen to go out the side door. I wanted to go around to the
    front door from the outside to see what the squirrel was up to.</p>
    <p>Sure enough, there he was clawing and gnawing at the front door.
    Upon closer inspection, I realized he wasn’t trying to get back in
    my house. His foot was securely caught between the door and the
    threshold weather-stripping. He was merely trying to free himself
    and get the heck out of Dodge. He was terrified as I approached and
    tried with renewed desperation to dislodge his foot.</p>
    <p>My first thought was to find a big stick and put the miserable
    little beast out of its misery. After all, he had caused me quite a
    fright and I could get rabies or Ebola or some other terrible
    disease from the bite he gave me. But now he was in my power. It was
    the perfect opportunity to get my revenge.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, that first urge didn’t last long. As I watched his
    desperation, my heart softened and I realized that he was just a
    poor little critter that wanted to get back to his home in the
    forest. Maybe it was a mother squirrel that had little babies to
    take care of or perhaps it was a young squirrel that didn’t know
    that humans and cats were bad news. I opened the door just enough
    for it to remove its foot and skitter away.</p>
    <p>As I watched it run with a bit of a limp into the forest, my
    anger melted away. I then realized that compassion was a much better
    emotion than anger or desire for revenge. I felt my peace restored
    and a great relief that the poor little fellow was once again free
    to live his simple life in the forest. I hoped that the contrast
    between the two emotions would help me make the same choice the next
    time I felt that I had been wronged by someone else. Compassion for
    my fellow men and forgiveness for their human weaknesses will always
    be the better choice.</p>
