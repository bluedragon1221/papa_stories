        <h1>Some Rain Must Fall</h1>
        <!-- TODO: remove escaped characters -->
        <p>The saying goes, &quot;Into every life some rain must fall.&quot; As I
        look back I would have to say very little rain has fallen into
        my life. When Lori and I began our lives together our motto was,
        &quot;We&#39;re so lucky!&quot; It seemed like everything was going so well in
        our early years together that we were being blessed much more
        than we deserved. We even considered etching this motto on the
        inside of our wedding rings. Everything was roses and life
        couldn&#39;t get much better.<br />
        <br />
        There have been only two times in my adult life when my sorrow
        was so great that I was reduced to bitter tears of grief. I have
        kept these times to myself. Not even Lori knows about these two
        times. I feel I can share them now because it is a part of the
        point I started out with. Only two times of overwhelming grief
        in 45 years of adulthood is still a pretty good deal.<br />
        <br />
        The first time happened in Windham. I had just returned home
        after attending the disciplinary council for Bill Chase which
        ended in his being excommunicated from the church. Normally,
        only high council members attend these meetings, but I was there
        as his bishop. I was so blind-sided by the whole situation that
        I was in shock. I was his bishop and home teacher, but had not
        seen this coming. I was alone in my bedroom thinking about the
        gravity of the occasion. The enormity of the eternal impact on
        so many lives overcame me to the point that I was consumed with
        grief and wept bitterly. I felt like a total failure as both the
        spiritual leader and stewardship holder over the welfare of
        these people.<br />
        <br />
        The second time happened many years later after Lori and I had
        moved back into the homestead house in Ridgefield. Getting laid
        off in Maine was a severe shock and a personal tragedy, but I
        held it together because there was so much to do to relocate
        from one coast to the other. Through the years of figuring out
        what I was going to do with myself, I just kept my head down and
        trudged forward. It was one of the most difficult challenges I
        had ever faced. I had to totally re-invent myself, at least in a
        worldly career sense. It was a difficult time, but not one
        filled with grief. I still had Lori at my side and a wonderful
        loving family to fall back on. I actually really enjoyed going
        back to school. I felt very fortunate that I was able to do this
        and not have to accumulate a staggering pile of debt. Then I
        landed my dream job with Hewlett Packard. This was the
        culmination of three years of struggle and effort. I finally
        felt like I had completed the re-invention process. I fully
        expected my life to return to the earlier state of bliss and
        roses.<br />
        <br />
        Loosing this dream job was a total devastation. My brother Tom
        and I were working at the same job site and commuted to and from
        work together. After being laid off, I had nowhere to go because
        Tom had driven his car that day. Upon hearing the bad news, he
        offered to take me home. It was a silent and sober drive home,
        but I held my grief in. Lori was not home when I arrived there
        and my grief finally spilled out in great waves of sobbing that
        surprised even me. Once again, my dream had been shattered. By
        the time Lori arrived home, I had recovered sufficiently to
        appear somewhat normal.<br />
        <br />
        Looking back at these times of sorrow, I can consider them with
        the perspective that comes with time. How can I deny that I have
        had a wonderful life when I can only remember two times of grief
        severe enough to cause me to weep? All the rest has been full of
        joy and gladness. It adds up to a colossal, good deal if you ask
        me. I wouldn&#39;t want to trade my life for anyone else&#39;s, no siree
        bob.</p>
