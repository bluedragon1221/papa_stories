        <h1>Survival Journal - Week 4</h1>
        <p>Non-journal comment: Week 4 consisted of a forced march on
        Monday and Student Expedition the remainder of the week. Student
        Expeditions are smaller than group expeditions. There were about
        three students in each group.</p>
        <p>The staff finally came at 7:30 Sunday Morning. We held a
        short Priesthood meeting and then had our fast and testimony
        meeting. It lasted for three hours and the spirit was strong. We
        had to use berries for the Sacrament.</p>
        <p>At 12:30 they passed out food to each family group. First, we
        devoured a watermelon. Then we whomped up some oatmeal and lumpy
        dick to last us until dinner. Dinner was fried chicken, cooked
        vegetables, and cinnamon ash cakes. I was so full of oatmeal
        that I could hardly eat the dinner and soon after my Revenge
        started again.</p>
        <p>At 7:00 we had a meeting at which it was announced that our
        forced march would begin that night at midnight. We were to hike
        25 miles to Eggnog Cabin as fast as we could. I wasn’t exactly
        overjoyed but slept for a few hours with my bedroll rolled and
        ready to go. The gun went off at 12:30 when the moon was out to
        light the way. Everybody took off; some began to run, and I was
        doing fine in second place</p>
        <p>when the Revenge struck a powerful blow. I lost 4 places and
        most of my will power. I began again with cramps in my stomach.
        It was an endlessly long, spooky walk through ghostly, moonlit
        desert canyons and mesas. After a while, my pains eased, and I
        settled into a steady pace. At 6:30 I watched an incredibly
        beautiful sunrise and I think I learned a very deep appreciation
        of desert scenery. At 7:30 Lynn, Ted and I all walked into
        Eggnog together and first. We had covered 25 miles in seven
        hours of hard pushed hiking. I thought my legs were going to
        fall off and I grew some prize-winning blisters, but I was there
        and happy. I am now resting in the shade. Kids have been coming
        in all morning. Most of them were in by 10, but some of those
        poor kids are still out in the desert at 12:30. It’s very hot
        here in the shade and I hate to imagine what those poor kids are
        going through. Kelly came in about 7 pm and Doug came in with a
        crutch and bad back at 10 pm.</p>
        <p>Monday night we made preparations for student expedition
        week. This is a period of 4-5 days where small groups of
        students are sent out on their own with maps and faith to cover
        50-70-mile distances. Ted, Kelly and I are one of the groups. We
        were given food packs for the week and then each group met
        individually with the staff to discuss their expedition. We had
        a final fireside for instructions before we separated.</p>
        <p>Some groups left as early as 4 am Tuesday morning, but ours
        didn’t leave until 7:30. Kelly was still exhausted from the
        forced march and the going was extremely slow. We finally
        reached the first water drop 8 miles out of camp at 11:30. There
        were three other groups there too, some with ill members. We all
        planned to wait there at the water drop until about 4 in the
        afternoon when it cooled off a little. When the time came to
        leave, we found that there was barely enough water for half a
        pop can apiece. The nearest water ahead was 20 miles away and we
        were quite worried. Ted had begun to feel a little sick during
        the afternoon rest and Kelly was still tired. Since I was the
        only one with much energy left, I decided to walk two miles back
        to an old reservoir for water. I carried two canteens and two
        billy cans and arrived at the reservoir in 40 minutes. I got
        back at 5:45 and found Ted writhing in pain. The rest</p>
        <p>of the groups had left, so I was alone and quite helpless to
        do anything. Kelly and I gave Ted a blessing and set up camp
        since it was obvious that we would not be moving anymore that
        day. A car came by, but the most they could do for us was give
        us some good drinking water for Ted.</p>
        <p>Wednesday Morning Ted is feeling a little better, but he is
        still very sick. Our water is getting low and I am getting very
        worried. We are very far behind schedule now. I have no idea
        then we will be able to move or if help will ever come if it is
        needed. There is nothing I can do but pray out here in the
        middle of the desert. Frankly, I am a bit frustrated and
        discouraged.</p>
        <p>The back-up truck finally came by to pick up their water
        buckets at 2:30. They were very surprised to see us still there
        and asked what the problem was. After examining Ted and talking
        to him for a long while he decided to continue on with Kelly and
        me. They told him he should depend totally upon the Lord to help
        him face this great physical challenge. They filled our canteens
        and said goodbye once again. We finally left at 4 pm. even
        though Ted was in considerable pain. We had to walk some 16
        miles that afternoon to the next water and expected to be
        walking far into the night. It was nearly 10 pm when we made it
        to the junction where the water drop was. To our surprise, two
        of the other boys groups were there too. Ted was feverish and
        quite exhausted from our long uphill climb that day. I certainly
        admire his courage and determination. During the course of our
        walking, we crossed Capital Reef National Park and climbed the
        switchbacks to the petrified wood junction.</p>
        <p>I must tell you about a desert thundershower we encountered
        along the way. First, the air becomes very still, and you see
        these huge billowy clouds come rolling in. Then, the wind begins
        to blow in violent little gusts, and you can smell that newly
        wetted dirt smell in the air. Next, you watch a sparkling sheet
        of rain roll toward you and before you know it you are enveloped
        in a downpour of huge warm rain drops while the sun is still
        shining and making the wet desert rocks glisten. It’s all over
        in about 20 minutes and the desert becomes as dry as it was
        before.</p>
        <p>Thursday morning, we cooked a delicious lentil and dog food
        (TVP) stew. We left camp at 10 a.m. Ted&#39;s condition was somewhat
        improved, and we made good progress. We followed the Petrified
        Wood road to the Veda Mine Road. Then we finally entered
        Wolverine Canyon where we shortly discovered a beautiful little
        spring and made camp at 5 pm. We arrived in very good spirits
        and had greatly enjoyed each other&#39;s company and the terrain
        that day. I was filling the role of head cook which I greatly
        enjoyed. We had a big pot of cracked wheat and milk with brown
        sugar. We finally retired after a good long fireside chat. It is
        very difficult to explain just how much I am enjoying my student
        expedition now that everything is going so well. My feet are
        fine, the revenge is gone, the food is quite good and we have
        not even been worried about where we are or whether we will have
        water yet. It’s all just so great, and sadly enough drawing to a
        close.</p>
        <p>Friday morning, we broke camp early because we had a long way
        to go before the day was over. We followed Wolverine into Horse
        Canyon. There we traveled most of the day through high walled
        canyons and dry riverbeds. Towards evening we started to follow
        the Kings Bench trail, hoping to find a cattle trough of water
        as our camping spot. We found it at the base of a steeply
        ascending canyon at 5 pm. Our meal was lumpy dick over TVP
        (texturized vegetable protein) and it was very good. We expected
        to make the last leg of our journey up the ravine and over
        King&#39;s Bench tomorrow morning. When we arrive at Base Camp in
        the Gulch, we will have traveled somewhere around 250 miles. Our
        student expedition alone was in excess of 50 miles I believe.
        The last mileage we will have to cover from the Gulch will be
        our 12-mile run in to Boulder from the Gulch after solo.</p>
        <p>Sunday-- Ah, solo is so peaceful and relaxing, but that’s
        getting ahead of myself; back to where I left off.</p>
        <p>Saturday morning, we rose and had a leisurely breakfast. We
        napped a little before breaking camp and were in no hurry to
        leave because we anticipated a short hike into base camp.
        Leaving at 9:30, we started the steep ascent up the ravine which
        led to Kings Bench. It took us an hour of heavy panting to reach
        the top, but it was certainly worth it. From the top you could
        see for miles in all directions.</p>
        <p>In looking across the bench we could see Long Canyon. Long
        Canyon branches off from the Gulch so we decided to drop into
        Long and follow it to the Gulch. However, several attempts to
        descend ended in steep 200 ft. cliffs. Finally, we came to a
        point where we could see the entire canyon. The whole thing was
        walled with cliffs and there was no way in. It was nearly noon
        when we discovered this and it was getting very hot. We had
        expected to be in base camp by noon so we hadn’t carried much
        water.</p>
        <p>Worry started to furrow our brows, but we decided to bear
        southwest and try to enter the Gulch through a long narrow
        canyon. We hiked for several hours and entered the top of the
        narrow canyon. We came upon a water pot which had hundreds of
        polywogs and little green flecks. I drank my fill anyway because
        of my thirst.</p>
        <p>The going was pretty tough and several times appeared to be
        foiled by drop-offs. Each time we would discover a ledge or a
        crack in the wall which would let us pass. Finally, as we
        followed a ledge we came into view of the Gulch and shortly
        found a way down. We came joyfully walking into base camp soon
        after. It felt like a long-awaited home-coming to see our
        leaders and those cheerful girls again. All the girls groups
        were already there, but we were the first boys group to arrive
        at about 5 pm. When we got there the girls were rappelling down
        a 150-foot cliff. I was very anxious to rappel too, so we
        prepared our solo food packs and were about to take the path up
        to the top of the cliff when misfortune came.</p>
        <p>Great storm clouds had moved in and it began to thunder and
        lightning. Then the rains came in such floods that soon the
        whole canyon floor began to flow. The lightning was spectacular,
        and the thunder was deafening. Most of us were thoroughly soaked
        before long. I managed to stay a little dry by standing under a
        little overhang. The storm passed after about an hour, but it
        left behind a muddy mess. What was earlier a cool, clear little
        canyon stream was now a muddy red little river. I had visions of
        having to drink that stuff all through solo.</p>
        <p>By this time the other boys groups had arrived and we began
        to organize to go out on Solo. Those of us who hadn&#39;t gotten to
        rappel would do so Wednesday after solo was over. We boys
        followed the leaders up the Gulch where they left us one by one
        at our own little sites along the way. I was given my site about
        9 pm when the light was beginning to fade. It is a little ledge
        about 30 feet above the creek. A large overhang juts out over it
        and gives me just enough room to stand. From my little perch
        here, I command a view of the stream below. Nothing can pass
        below me without my notice.</p>
