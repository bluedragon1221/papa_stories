        <h1>The Picture Window Near Miss</h1>
        <p>Let&#39;s skip forward a few years. You would think by now I
        would have gained a little experience and wisdom in the
        pyrotechnic arts. At this point I was perhaps a little
        over-confident that the days of my mishaps were long gone. This
        turned out to be true in this instance only because of blind
        luck or divine intervention, I&#39;m not sure which.<br />
        <br />
        After hearing of my love for the field of &quot;energetic chemistry&quot;,
        Emily&#39;s sister-in-law, Val, invited me to conduct a workshop at
        her home in Eagle, Idaho for her son, who shared my interest in
        science and rockets. I was eager to convert a young and
        impressionable mind to the field and, of course, I couldn&#39;t turn
        down an opportunity to play with explosives and such.
        Accordingly, I prepared for a few weeks prior to our next visit
        to Idaho and brought a large box of chemicals and supplies for
        the workshop.<br />
        <br />
        Val and her husband Brian lived in a very upscale,
        multi-million-dollar home on a large lot at the outskirts of
        Eagle. I remember being quite impressed with the expansive shop
        where we started building a few fireworks items. We made a few
        simple things like fountains and roman candles and then went
        outside on the lawn to light them off. The event was slated to
        conclude with a static test of a small rocket motor. This was a
        motor that used the same kind of solid rocket motor fuel as the
        space shuttle booster engines. It was about 12 inches long and
        used a custom machined solid graphite rocket nozzle. I was quite
        proud of the accomplishment of designing and building this
        motor, which I has successfully test fired on several previous
        occasions. This time, however, I planned to use a new static
        test stand that had never been used before.<br />
        <br />
        We set up the rocket motor in the test stand and inserted the
        electrically controlled engine ignitor. Brian and Val&#39;s young
        son would be given the privilege of doing the count-down and
        pushing the ignition button. A successful test-firing would have
        resulted in a loud roaring noise and a lot of fire and smoke
        coming from the nozzle of the motor. All this was supposed to
        happen while the motor was safely contained in the test stand.
        Well, my young protégé eagerly did his job and pushed the button
        after counting down from five. The rocket motor roared to life,
        just as expected. Then it somehow managed to break loose from
        the test stand and began to fly uncontrollably in the air. My
        heart sank as the motor headed right towards the largest picture
        window of the house at about 100 miles an hour. I was all but
        certain that I was going to be responsible for thousands of
        dollars’ worth of damage to Val&#39;s beautiful home. This is when
        the miracle happened.<br />
        <br />
        It appeared as if the motor hit an invisible force field, just
        like the ones that protect the spaceships in the Star Wars
        movies. The motor abruptly flipped around, right in mid-air and
        started heading out toward the field beyond the lawn. I heaved a
        huge sigh of relief when the motor finally ran out of fuel and
        landed safely in the field about 40 yards away from the house.
        Once again, I was incredibly lucky that no one was hurt and that
        no damage was done. However, the near miss did some serious
        damage to my reputation as a rocket scientist. I seriously
        considered whether I should retire from this hazardous hobby,
        but only for about 2 seconds.</p>
