    <h1>The Volkswagen that Couldn’t</h1>
    <p>1978</p>
    <p>Shortly after my wife and I were married, we decided to drive to
    Canada to visit her parents. We were still starving students and had
    to make the trip in my wife’s orange Volkswagen Beetle. The route
    required us to cross through a few mountain ranges somewhere in
    Montana. On this occasion, my wife was driving. We were following a
    big freight truck as we began to climb up a steep mountain. The
    truck began to slow down as the hill became steeper. This stretch of
    highway had only two lanes. Thus, the only way to get by the big
    truck was to pass him on the left.</p>
    <p>There was another car behind us. We both grew impatient to get
    around the slow moving truck, but the on-coming traffic was too
    heavy. The minutes of waiting for an opportunity to pass the truck
    became agonizing. The tension and the stress were building. Finally,
    a gap in the on-coming traffic presented our best chance to pass the
    truck. Lori pulled the beetle into the left lane and put the pedal
    to the metal. To our great dismay, the Volkswagen did not surge
    forward with a burst of speed as hoped. One quarter mile ahead,
    another vehicle was speeding toward us in the left lane. Our poor
    little Volkswagen was not making much progress getting around that
    truck. The situation was getting very tense.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the car that had been behind us pulled up nearer to
    the truck, making it impossible for us to move back into the right
    lane to avoid a head-on collision. Now, we were both truly
    frightened. The Volkswagen was not going to get around the truck in
    time. Lori took the only option left. She braked hard to allow the
    truck and the car behind it to move ahead. We slipped back into the
    right lane and out of harm’s way just as the on-coming car flew by
    with its horn blowing.</p>
    <p>I will never forget the expression on the face of the driver of
    the car that had been behind us. As we were braking to get back into
    the right lane, I could clearly see a look of amusement as he sped
    ahead on the right. I will never know if his actions that day were
    deliberate, but in my heightened state of distress, I assumed he had
    intentionally placed our lives in danger just so he could have a
    good chuckle.</p>
    <p>For the next 20 or 30 minutes, I was silently fuming. I
    entertained all manner of grisly methods of exacting revenge on this
    pathetic excuse for a human being. My fantasies involved the use of
    weapons such as sledge hammers, machetes and double barreled
    shotguns. I was so consumed by my anger and indignation that I could
    not rationally analyze what was happening to me. At length, I
    finally realized that I was only prolonging my mental anguish by
    feeding my rage with thoughts of revenge. Finally, after a long
    time, I was able to listen to the still, small voice inside me. That
    voice told me that the only way to become triumphant in this
    situation was to adopt a spirit of forgiveness. Then, and only then,
    was my personal peace restored.</p>
    <p>In retrospect, that driver did me a great favor that day. He
    helped me learn a valuable lesson early in life that has served me
    well ever since.</p>
