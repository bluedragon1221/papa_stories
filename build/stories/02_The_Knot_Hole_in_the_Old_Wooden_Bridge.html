        <h1>The Knot Hole in the Old Wooden Bridge</h1>
        <p>Circa 1958</p>
        <p>This event happened over 50 years ago, but its effects will
        last forever. I was only 5 years old. My father decided to take
        me on my first fishing trip. We drove in the car to one of his
        favorite fishing places on a stream near an old wooden bridge.
        He patiently showed me how to bait the hook, how to cast the
        baited hook into the middle of the stream and how to slowly reel
        it back in to attract the attention of the trout that lived in
        the stream. He watched me try it a few times and then, satisfied
        that I had mastered the art, he went upstream a short distance
        to try his own luck with another fishing pole.</p>
        <p>Now, Dad taught me well the mechanics of trying to catch a
        fish, but he didn’t mention that it required a lot of patience
        and a fair amount of diligent effort. After about 10 minutes of
        trying to catch a fish with no success, I began to get weary of
        doing the same thing over and over again. Many times my fishing
        line got tangled in the branches of the bushes by the stream. I
        thought surely there must be a better way to convince a fish to
        eat the tasty earthworm on my fishing hook. That is when I
        noticed the old wooden bridge.</p>
        <p>I walked onto the old bridge and looked around. In one of the
        weathered old planks of the bridge I noticed a knot hole that
        was just big enough to lower my baited hook through it and into
        the water of the stream below. I was quite pleased with myself.
        This was so much easier than casting the hook from the shore of
        the stream.</p>
        <p>Before long, a beautiful 12 inch long brook trout spied my
        bait and ended up firmly hooked on my fishing line. I was
        actually somewhat startled and began to reel in my line with
        great excitement. It soon became evident that my brilliant
        decision to use the knot hole was not so brilliant after all.
        The fish was simply too big to fit through the hole.</p>
        <p>In my panic, I began to scream for my father to come help me.
        When my father perceived the nature of the dilemma, he realized
        he had a choice to make. He could either emphasize the stupidity
        of my decision or he could make a fond memory that would last a
        lifetime. Fortunately, he chose the latter. He waded into the
        water and retrieved my beautiful rainbow colored brook trout.
        His clothes were soaking wet clear up to his chest, but he was
        my hero that day. He reaffirmed his love for me even on those
        occasions when I was not in my best form. The lesson and the
        example are a part of me to this day.</p>
        <p>What lessons of life are contained in this story? There are
        many. First, we should preserve these stories of our lives by
        writing them in a journal so they may be passed down to our
        posterity as a legacy of love for the gospel and its principles.
        Second, we should always maintain our worthiness to receive
        guidance from the Holy Ghost. He will help us make wise
        decisions on those occasions when we must choose how to react to
        difficult situations. Finally, we must never underestimate the
        power of our influence on others. Choices, which seem quite
        insignificant in the moment, might make an impression on someone
        else that will last a lifetime.</p>
