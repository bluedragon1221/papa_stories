        <h1>The Basement Window Non-Miss</h1>
        <p>It was as if the dark-side forces were really miffed that I
        had escaped the shame of shattering a very expensive picture
        widow in my last misadventure. They plotted to get even with me
        on a different occasion not too far in the future. Lori and I
        now lived in the homestead house on 29th avenue. My interest in
        rockets had not diminished. I still dabbled in both fireworks
        and rocketry. I was a bit more cautious about conducting tests,
        as least as far as trying to diminish the risk to human beings.
        But the risks to houses and windows was alas, still
        considerable, as you will soon see.</p>
        <p>My reputation as a firebug had grown within the circle of my
        acquaintances in the Ridgefield Ward. I now had a young protege
        whose name was Alex Zwingly. He was the 15-year-old son of good
        friends of ours in the ward. I was quite delighted to take him
        under my wing and teach him all the fascinating knowledge of the
        pyrotechnic arts I had acquired over the years. I suppose the
        best lesson I taught him was that the hobby is dangerous and
        perhaps not worth the consequences of the inevitable
        accidents.</p>
        <p>On this occasion, we had planned to do yet another static
        test firing of a black power rocket motor. I tried to be
        prepared for the unexpected. I constructed a blast shield of
        sorts, behind which Alex and I would stand as we ignited the
        rocket motor. The test stand was mounted on a table placed in
        the back yard, a good 30 yards from the East-facing side of the
        house. Our launch pad control center was located about 20 feet
        away from the test stand. This was where the shield was located.
        It consisted of a piece of plywood to which I had attached a
        piece of plexiglass. The plywood was mounted vertically, with
        the plexiglass on the top edge, so that Alex and I could view
        the test stand through the plexiglass window. Thus, we would be
        protected from any deadly bits of flying debris in the event
        that the motor over-pressured and exploded. Again, I was feeling
        a tad-bit overconfident that my high-tech blast shield would
        prevent all manner of consequences from any mishaps due to the
        test-firing. What could possibly go wrong??</p>
        <p>Well, Alex pressed the ignition button and the rocket roared
        into life. All went well for about 58 milliseconds. Then, there
        was a nice loud POW, followed by the unmistakable sound of
        breaking glass. The motor had indeed over-pressured, but it
        didn’t exactly explode. Apparently, the clay nozzle of the
        rocket motor had been ejected out of the rocket motor tube, just
        like a cannon ball. I suppose it was a good example of the law
        of averages. All the incredible good luck I had had during past
        disasters had finally run out. The clay nozzle managed to sail
        all the way over to the house and took out one of the basement
        windows. At least it only broke one of the outer storm-window
        panes. The inner windowpane was still intact, so the damage
        wasn’t so severe that the TV room in the basement was exposed to
        the elements. The window is still broken to this day, another
        testament to my lack of foresight. Who knew that I had
        constructed a mortar shell instead of a properly functioning
        rocket motor?? Oh, well…. Alex thought it was all great fun and
        excitement. He will have a great story to tell his grandchildren
        someday. At least, no one could say I was derelict in my efforts
        to protect life and limb. Our high-tech blast shield worked
        perfectly to keep us safe during the explosion.</p>
