    <h1>A Date with Eternity</h1>
    <p>I was in my junior year of the engineering program at Brigham
    Young University when my student ward decided to organize a climb to
    the top of Mount Timpanogos near Provo, Utah. It was in the spring
    of 1978. The snow was gone from the mountain, but the weather was
    still a little unpredictable. Our group of hardy adventurers was
    composed of fellow students, most of whom were good friends. We set
    out one fine evening and took our sleeping bags with us to the trail
    head at the base of the mountain. We planned to sleep under the
    stars and arise at about 4am to get an early start up the
    mountain.</p>
    <p>Lori and I were seriously dating at the time, but we were not yet
    engaged to be married. We both looked forward to sharing the
    experience of climbing the mountain together. The trail was not
    extremely rugged, but the distance to the peak was considerable, at
    about 7 miles. When 4am arrived, we all embarked together, anxious
    to meet the challenge of conquering a worthy mountain peak.</p>
    <p>Until the sun came up, we had to be careful where we placed our
    feet on the trail because of the darkness. Soon, however, the sun
    began to rise and the beauties of the mountain became visible. The
    day started gloriously and appeared to be likely to offer just the
    right conditions for a day of hiking. Unfortunately, our luck began
    to rapidly change. Before we had arrived at the peak, the clouds
    began to thicken and it started to rain. Our group decided to avoid
    taking any greater risks in the poor weather and chose to abandon
    our goal to reach the top of the mountain. It was a long, cold march
    in the rain as we trudged back down the muddy trail. The mood was a
    bit somber because our lofty goal had been demolished by the
    weather. We were all quite soaked by the rain and thoroughly cold
    and miserable.</p>
    <p>It was under these rather dismal conditions when an impression
    began to form in my mind. This impression would have eternal
    consequences. I began to understand how adversity can often reveal a
    person’s true nature. I observed how Lori reacted to our present
    unfavorable circumstances and was quite impressed with how well she
    held up under the trial. She looked like a half-drowned cat, but
    remained cheerful and determined to stay positive. She didn’t utter
    a single complaint or allow her mood to turn sour. I realized that
    her strength of character would be a valuable trait in an eternal
    companion. I began to realize how much I needed this kind of
    influence in my life. The impression grew and matured until I asked
    her to marry me a few months later. That day on the mountain, I may
    have lost the contest with nature, but I found my soul-mate. She has
    been my main source of joy and comfort ever since.</p>
