    <h1>The Wedding Proposal Fiasco</h1>
    <p>After a few years of doing my own fireworks, I guess I had built
    a reputation in the family as the guy to see about doing something
    really impressive for special occasions. Perhaps Dan Clark hadn&#39;t
    heard all the family stories about the failures and fiascos, because
    he seemed to have full confidence that I could create a memorable
    experience on the occasion when he wanted to ask our daughter Emily
    to marry him. It was sometime in the summer of 2001 when Dan asked
    me to create a fireworks display where the finale would be a big
    sparkling depiction of the proposal, &quot;Will you marry me, Emily?&quot; Dan
    had already done his duty earlier and asked me for my permission to
    ask her the big question. Now he wanted me to make a memory that
    would become legend in the family annuls. In that regard, I was
    somewhat successful, but not quite the way I had intended.<br />
    <br />
    For the next few weeks, I planned and constructed the fireworks show
    that would be performed at the Miele farm about a half mile away
    from our home in Windham. My plan was to construct the display for
    the wedding proposal out of sparklers arranged in such a way as to
    spell out the words of the question. The sparklers were mounted on a
    framework of peg board sheets mounted to vertical posts that were
    sledge-hammered into the ground. Now, the professionals often do
    something similar to create a display of some kind of a figure, like
    an eagle head or some other patriotic symbol, for fireworks show
    finales. However, they are usually constructed using tubes of slow
    burning chemicals, called &quot;lances&quot;, such that the fiery display is
    visible for about 20 to 30 seconds. I reasoned that I could create
    the same effect of using sparklers instead of the customary lances.
    Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have time to test my new innovation to see
    if the effect would be the same. I simply forged ahead confident
    that my knowledge of fireworks construction was based on sound
    principles.<br />
    <br />
    The only real trick to the display, I reasoned, was to get all the
    sparklers lit in a short amount of time, so the whole display was
    visible at once. To do this, I created hundreds of feet of a special
    kind of fuse called &quot;sticky match&quot;. It is nothing more than a train
    of gun powder placed down the middle of ordinary clear packing tape.
    When properly attached to the ends of the sparklers, the sticky
    match was supposed to burn very quickly, at approximately 10 feet
    per second, so it would light all the sparklers in a matter of a few
    seconds. I could just imagine in my mind the wonder and awe on the
    faces of my enraptured audience when they beheld the majesty of my
    creation as it dramatically lit the night sky.<br />
    <br />
    On the night of the fateful event, I successfully lit the smaller
    items that I had constructed for the early part of the fireworks
    show. All was going well until I lit the fuse for the finale. The
    sticky match worked beautifully. It quickly raced along as intended
    and lit all the sparklers in short order. However, the sparklers
    burned so hot that they didn&#39;t just burn at the tip, like a sparkler
    is supposed to do. Instead of creating a nice sparkly sentence, the
    whole display went up in a big ball of fire and then went out just
    as suddenly. Instead of gasps of excitement and cheers from the
    audience, there was only an awkward air of confusion. Dan Clark knew
    it was his big moment and did some quick thinking to salvage the
    opportunity of his lifetime. He quickly ran over to where Emily was
    standing and got down on one knee and asked Emily if she would be
    his wife for time and all eternity. Before Emily could answer, I
    explained to her that I had constructed a final fireworks piece that
    would allow her to reply with more than a verbal &quot;yes or no&quot;. I had
    made two fireworks fountains for this purpose. If Emily lit one of
    them, the answer would be no, but if she lit two, the answer would
    be yes.<br />
    <br />
    The night air was tense with anticipation as Emily slowly made her
    way over to the place where the two fountains awaited her choice.
    She lit the first one, which shot a few paltry sparks about 5 feet
    into the air. Then, she lit the second one. It was a huge monster
    that ejected bright golden sparks nearly 80 feet into the air. It
    was intended to be a dramatic way to say, &quot;Of course I will marry
    you!!&quot; It was a memorable contrast to the earlier epic failure. This
    time, I achieved the effect I had hoped to see on the faces of
    everyone present as the huge fountain roared to life and filled the
    darkness with a spectacular painting of fire.<br />
    <br />
    Fortunately, the final success erased the shame of the first
    failure. It was a night to remember and an eternity to celebrate.
    The results of that decision have been just as spectacular and will
    build a legacy of love and devotion that will endure forever.</p>
