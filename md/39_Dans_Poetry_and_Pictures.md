I can\'t claim to be a talented poet, but lately I\'ve begun to dabble
in writing a few of my thoughts in verse form instead of the usual story
form. You can expect to be a little underwhelmed by my efforts, but
I\'ve thoroughly enjoyed this new form of expression. I suppose it's
just a phase.\
\
The first one is a bit tongue-in-cheek and contains a lot of detail that
perhaps only Lori would understand. If you\'re left a little confused by
some of the wording, feel free to inquire of my sweetheart to whom it
was written.\
\
**My Joy is Nigh Unbounded**\
\
Love is more than kindness, \
And not just simple care. \
It\'s a hope of endless greetings  \
Of delight instead of glare. \
 \
When I walk into the room  \
After duty has kept me away. \
It lifts my soul and sagging spirit \
To hear you turn and say, \
\
\"Oh dah-ling, how was your day?\"\
\
But you seldom leave the moment,\
And expect that I will fill it.\
You\'ve got much more to say,\
And are dying just to spill it.\
\
With a knowing smile, I hold my breath.\
Your question to me was but obliga-tory.\
I know the drill and that I must keep still,\
So that you can continue your story.\
\
\"My day was simply dreadful,\" you\'ll say.\
\"I lost at every turn. \
My silly partner did his best \
To make my money burn.\" \
 \
\"I tried Uno, poker, go fish and Canasta. \
I only managed even then to lose my money fasta. \
Oh dah-ling, I hope you\'ll understand. \
To salvage all my tattered pride,\
I must play another hand.\" \
 \
\"Your supper\'s in the fridge, and while you\'re in the kitchen, \
Kindly disregard my grousin\' and my itchin\'.\
Be a dear and do me a favor please \
And fill my cup with chocolate treats,\
The kind you get from Cee\'s.\" \
 \
So you see my dear, it\'s very clear. \
My joy is nigh unbounded.  \
The things I hear are oh so dear. \
My fears were quite unfounded. \
 \
I love to greet you every time  \
And discover what you\'ll say. \
My life with you is never dull. \
I\'d want it no other way. 

The next project is a list of things for which I am grateful. I wrote it
on Thanksgiving of 2015. Each phrase has an illustrative photo below.

This is a silly little poem I posted on my Chinese blog.\
\
It is said that a hug a day keeps the blues away.\
Well, one is quite nice and two is okay,\
But three is much better and four is HOORAY!!!\
\
Four awesome hugs below:

The final one captures my greatest desire for all of my amazing
posterity. It also expresses how I imagine our Heavenly Father must feel
about each of us.\
\
The Light\
\
Embrace the light, oh child of noble lineage.\
Turn not away from the path that leads to joy.\
Thy soul hath greater potential than thou,\
In thy infant musings, can imagine.\
Follow the whisperings from deep within thy murky memory.\
Build the hope that greatness lies within thy grasp.\
Embrace the light, oh child of divine heritage.\
Thy soul will be magnified.\
Thy comfort will be endless.\
Thy works will be like beacons on the hilltops.\
If only thou wilt turn towards the light.
