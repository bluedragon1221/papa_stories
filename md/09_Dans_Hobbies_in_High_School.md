moral: We all come from humble beginnings. Keep the humility throughout your life

Basically, I was the classical definition of a nerd. Judge for
yourself...

I had the second highest GPA in my class and the big glasses and social
awkwardness. Instead of being the sports jock with the big muscles, I
was a member of the chess club. Here we are at a chess match where I am
playing chess with a member of the club. It doesn't get much nerdier
than this...

Besides chess, I also dabbled in photography. I even had my own darkroom
for developing and printing my photos. I commandeered the downstairs
bathroom to set up my enlarger and developing trays. These were the days
before digital photography. Everything was done with chemicals and
emulsion films. After several years of training, I managed to create my
crowning achievement shown below. I combined a photo of our family cat
with a photo of Sandra Frost, one of my secret crushes from my high
school class. I thought I surely would score big points by making her
look like an evil cat woman.

This is "Kitty". She never had a real name.

Sandra Frost. She was way out of my league.

Needless to say, Sandra was not impressed with my creation. The life of
a nerd is not easy, let me tell ya!!!
