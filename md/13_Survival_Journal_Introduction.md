title: Survival Journal - Introduction
---

This article is an introduction to the history of a month of my life
from July 24, 1973, to August 24, 1973. Officially, the experience was
titled "Youth Acculturation Course" hosted by Brigham Young University.
Unofficially, I always call it the desert survival course. The
experience had such a strong impact on my life that I want to include it
in its entirety in my life history. The following set of articles are
almost verbatim copies of the journal I kept while attending the course.
Other articles in this book are based on specific events from the course
and have been embellished by my memory after more than 40 years have
elapsed. (See [Melody's Malady](11_Melodys_Malady.html) and [Chocolate Waterfalls](12_Chocolate_Waterfalls.html)).

The events that led to my signing up for this course are unique. My
brother Tom and I attended a fireside that was designed as a recruiting
tool to attract students to take the course during their summer break.
We were both quite captured by the grand sense of adventure the
presentation portrayed and signed up to take the course together. It
turned out that Tom dropped the course for reasons unknown to me, but I
chose to take it without his companionship. I was planning to go on my
mission at the end of the summer and hoped it would be a good
character-building experience that would serve me well in the mission
field. Before I left home to go take this course, I had received my
mission call and knew I would be going to Brazil a few months after
returning.

Below I include two maps to pinpoint the location in Southeastern Utah
where the course was held. The first shows the general area relative to
familiar large cities in the state of Utah.

The map below shows a more detailed zoom-in of the route we took from
start to finish.

We started at Keg Knoll and ended in the town of Boulder. The total
length of the trek was a little over 250 miles.
