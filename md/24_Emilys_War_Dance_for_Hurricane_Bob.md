title: Emily's War Dance for Hurricane Bob
lesson: Don't let worry distract you from the magnificence of nature and unbridled emotional exuberance
---

August 20, 1991

Our young family lived in Windham, Maine. Our home was located in a
thick forest of pine trees. Hurricane Bob had arrived in its full fury.
The roar of the wind through the pine trees was deafening. It shrieked
through the trees with a sound that was truly frightening. The rain was
coming down in torrents. The trees were pitching and writhing with
alarming motion.Â  I was very worried that a tree would blow over and
crush my house or harm my family. However, my 11 year old daughter Emily
had a very different reaction to this spectacle. She grabbed an umbrella
and ran out onto our driveway to experience the full majesty of the
storm. She shouted and whooped and jumped with the excitement of the
moment. She was so inspired by the awesome power of nature that she
couldn't contain her emotions within her. They came flowing out in great
shouts of exuberance and leaps of pure, unbridled excitement. I remember
feeling envious of her ability to allow her emotions to explode to such
heights. I cannot remember ever being able to abandon all emotional
restraint like this. I was much too distracted by worry to consider
extracting some form of joy from this most unsettling occasion.
